"Schools across the country break for a two week holiday today. In Mombasa, this holiday period can prove to be a challenge for parents as our young men and women tend to be left at home idle and vulnerable to getting into bad vices.

I have today commissioned the Governor’s Mentorship Program that will see us take in 1,800 form four students from all wards in in public schools the pilot program. This program shall engage our students in productive activities including motivational talks, first aid certification and other useful skills trainings. For each day that the child attends, they will receive 150 shillings for their fare and lunch and 250 shillings shall go to a bursary fund to offset their school fees for the next term. All payments shall be through mobile money and shall be based on a biometric attendance register.

"Former President Kenyatta mourns Mau Mau heroine Mukami Kimathi

NAIROBI, 5th May 2023,– Former President Uhuru Kenyatta has mourned Mau Mau heroine Mukami Kimathi, describing her as an enduring symbol of Kenya’s  liberation struggle.

The former President said Mama Mukami, who passed on last night, continuously demonstrated the true spirit of patriotism and loyalty to the country.

“Throughout her life, Mama Mukami demonstrated what genuine patriotism means and how citizens  are supposed to  work towards the progress of their motherland.

“Indeed as a true patriot, she never failed to play her role  as a mentor and a leader worthy emulating,” said the former President.

The former Head of State pointed out that despite her health challenges in the recent past, Mama Mukami stood steadfastly not only for the welfare of her family but of the country as she continued to encourage those she interacted with to continue working for the good of the nation.

“Despite the health challenges which she experienced in her old age, Mama Mukami was always eager to support all leaders in finding tangible solutions to challenges facing the country.

"In times of political turmoil and social economic regression ,a good president will galvanise his people in a sense of nationhood by cutting his own budget as a show of example  E.g. Ruto should skip many useless overseas trips that gobble up to 300m per trip. A foreign officer can represent . His obnoxious office budget of 5b should be trimmed to 2B. Head of state attending churches every Sunday  cost 60m or more. In brief, keeping ruto inside Statehouse (working from home) will save more than 1B in one month, enough to pay our doctors and nurses.

It is gratifying to note that EABL's interventions align with the flagships under the Agricultural Sector Transformation and Growth Strategy (ASTGS), the Government manifesto, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on zero hunger, decent work, and economic growth. These efforts demonstrate that private sector entities can deploy business strategies that go beyond profit maximization and respond to the challenges faced by communities at all levels.

Officiated the closing ceremony of a 10-day Prison and Probation Officers Course (PriPOC) pre-deployment training for Correction Officers that saw 7 of our officers from Kenya (KPS 5 and PACS 2) from among the 23 officers who are from different countries that is Tanzania, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Sweden graduate and get certificates.

Indeed, the training will go a long way in ensuring peacekeeping after they have been trained and gained skills in strategic guidance framework-related aspects, Nelson Mandela Rules, Bangkok Rules, report writing, mentoring and advising among others.

After undergoing through the training, we are confident that the graduants will go out there and work diligently with the purposes of serving the general public in line with the UN peace keeping missions.

In the UN Peace Keeping Missions, Corrections work closely with other national authorities to promote and prioritize the peaceful resolution and prevention of disputes, strengthen the protection of civilians, improve national security, restore and extend the authority of the State, restore trust and confidence, promote social cohesion, and contribute to the implementation of peace agreements.

Appreciative to the Swedish Ambassador to Kenya Caroline Vicini for the support and also being present in the event, the Swedish Prison and Probation Service (SPPS) in collaboration with the United Nations (UN) in delivering the pre-deployment training for UN Corrections in readiness for duties in UN Peacekeeping Operations.

As a way of contributing towards afforestation program we managed to plant trees with the inmates and the prison officers. This is also part of ensuring the prisons farms have 20% forest cover which is a directive by HE the President.

Later on visited Maranjau GK Prison where they have put extra hard work on their industry and farm which is quite impressive and encouraging. With the hard work, enthusiasm and teamwork, the Correctional Department will be able to achieve additional positive outcomes which will benefit our Nation as a whole.

While on the field visits, we encourage the inmates to keep contact with their family members back at home as part of reconciliation which builds a safer and easier environment for the inmates to fit in once they have been reintegrated back into the society.

NAIROBI, 19th May 2023,– H.E. Uhuru Kenyatta, the Fourth President of the Republic of Kenya and former First Lady Margaret Kenyatta, today joined family and friends for a requiem mass of the late Popsy Bastiana D'Souza Getonga, wife of former President Mwai Kibaki's personal assistant Alfred Gitonga, at St. Austin's Catholic Church in Nairobi.

Until her demise, D'Souza was the Seychelles Tourism Ambassador and a successful Nairobi tour and travel operator whose business acumen was greatly admired in the tourism and hospitality industry.

D'Souza, popularly called Popsy, was eulogized and celebrated by her family and friends as a warm and passionate person who breathed energy into her environment.

The former President, who nostalgically reminisced their friendship years from back in Amherst College, Massachusetts, together with her husband Alfred and their peers, eulogized Popsy as a loyal and faithful friend who never shied from speaking her mind. He described her as one who touched the lives of many in different ways.

Other leaders who paid their glowing tributes included The Seychelles President Wavel Ramakalawan, whose condolence was read by a government representative and who eulogized the deceased as one who dispensed her duties diligently and with great enthusiasm.",0.0,92.0,745.0,https://twitter.com/4thPresidentKE/status/1659556180266569734,2023-05-19 13:46:41+00:00,118635.0,

The congress will offer valuable educational opportunities, promoting sustainable agriculture practices. It will also create avenues for inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work, particularly for youth and women in the sector.

"FORMER PRESIDENT KENYATTA DELIVERS A KEYNOTE ADDRESS AT THE NIGERIAN 2023 PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION LECTURE IN ABUJA.

ABUJA, 28TH MAY 2023 (OFPP) - His Excellency (Rtd) President Uhuru Kenyatta, the Fourth President of the Republic of Kenya, on Saturday, 27th May 2023, graced the 2023 Presidential Inauguration Lecture held at the International Conference Centre in Abuja, Nigeria. 

In his keynote address at the event, themed Deepening Democracy For Development, H.E Kenyatta pointed out the importance of democracy in spurring development in any country, especially in the African Continent. 

H.E Kenyatta shared his experience as a head of state for two terms, where he acknowledged the successes, failures, and opportunities of embracing democracy, articulating the importance of getting to the root causes of conflict within the continent and our African countries for the continent's development.

The former President further pointed out the three most fundamental issues weaponized to the detriment of our democratic growth as ethnicity, tribalism, and economic greed. 

"" I feel the three most fundamental issues that are easily weaponized to the detriment of our democratic growth. The first is negative ethnicity or tribalism, followed by religion, and lastly, economic greed,"" Kenyatta said.

Kenyatta expressed his confidence that if the continent addressed these issues in earnest, it would begin to harness its mineral wealth, agricultural potential, and abundant human capital to propel the people's well-being and strengthen the continent's voice in the global community of Nations. 

The former Head of State called on President-elect Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to unite all Nigerians irrespective of religion, tribe, political and other affiliations. He further urged him to embrace the inclusivity of all parties for a better Country.

""I speak to you as a brother and an elder statesman in leadership. The contest is now over, and the hard work of building a prosperous and unified Nigeria begins"", he said.  

Acknowledging the President-elect's task once he assumes office, H.E Kenyatta urged Tinubu to transcend an election's tactical politics and become Nigeria's vision bearer.

""I encourage you to surround yourself with the voices of those who will counterbalance the hardliners that feel entitled to a piece of your office. You will lose nothing and gain everything from reaching out across political, ethnic, and religious lines to those who may feel aggrieved by your victory in one way or another. Allow them to exhale and to be a part of your vision for a greater Nigeria."" He encouraged the President-Elect. 

The former Head of State congratulated the people of Nigeria for holding peaceful elections, overlooking the challenges, and embracing the lessons from a maturing democracy. 

Furthermore, he commended all the contestants for expressing their political differences within the provided framework of constitutional order urging them to shun divisive politics and embrace finding strength in their diversities. 

Other speakers who delivered their lecturers on different aspects included; His Eminence Mohammed Sa ád Abubakar III, C.F.R. Sultan of Sokoto & Most Rev. Dr. Mathew Hassan Kukah, Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, who spoke on Tolerance and Inclusiveness, Ms. Amina Jane Mohammed, G.C.O.N., Deputy Secretary-General (Security and Development), Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina, President, African Development Bank (AfDB) who emphasized on the importance of strengthening the Nigerian Economy and Mr. Dayo Israel, National Youth Leader, All Progressives Congress who spoke on the importance of youth inclusiveness in governance.

The outgoing President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, H.E. Muhammadu Buhari, who also attended the ceremony, noted that democracy was not merely a system of governance but a way of life that requires active participation, inclusivity, and relentless pursuit of justice and fairness. 

Also present was Vice President-elect Kashim Shettima, Deputy Speaker of the Nigeria National Assembly, Hon. Ahmed Idris, among other dignitaries.

The Inaugural Lecture organized by the Nigeria Presidential transition council aims to bridge the divisions prevalent in Nigerian society, foster dialogue, and promote collective responsibility toward national development.

The Presidential Inauguration Lecture is part of the activities organized to commemorate Nigeria's Seventh consecutive civilian transition.",0.0,83.0,614.0,https://twitter.com/4thPresidentKE/status/1662673268682240000,2023-05-28 04:12:52+00:00,55480.0,

Pull back. Listen to Kenyans.

Withdraw the Finance Bill 2023.

Postpone the implementation of the Housing Levy.

Return to the Drawing Board.

Hire new, independent and TRUTHFUL ADVISORS.

Reshuffle your communications team and hire two or three FRESH FACES.

Don’t rely on YES MEN and YES WOMEN.

Don’t be defensive.
Don’t argue with the PEOPLE.

Stop entrenching the perception that you are only hiring exclusively from TWO ETHNIC GROUPS.

Stop hiring and recycling incompetent failures and graft riddled conmen.

The reckless talk about TWO SHARE HOLDERS in a country of 50 million people is political suicide.

Mwai Kibaki was elected with 68% of votes but was defeated in a referendum 2 years later.

Conman @RailaOdinga is gaining popularity because many of the senior government officials you have appointed are failing to engage Kenyans in a transparent, respectful and accountable manner.

"The task force that was established by President William Ruto to review and regulate frameworks governing religious organisations in Kenya begins its public hearings tomorrow. I urge all Kenyans to candidly, honestly, and objectively submit their views to the 17-member team chaired by Rev. Mutava Musyimi. 

The Government will not back down on the resolve to weed out all rogue preachers who are using the Holy scriptures to mislead, radicalise, and indoctrinate their followers. 

The operation on criminals hiding behind religion is not a war against any faith or institution. Crime knows no religion. 

Third phase of exhumation of bodies at Shakahola forest commences tomorrow, Monday, 5th June 2023. Unfortunately, there are 22 mass graves that could contain multiple bodies. The search and rescue efforts continue uninterrupted with the multi-agency security team on the ground supported by aerial surveillance. 

At the same time, the security sector respects diversity of opinion on policy and political issues. However, the Government will not allow violent protests that culminate in looting, destruction of property, injuries on civilians and police officers, or loss of lives in the guise of expressing divergent opinion.

"THE FACILITATOR OF THE EAC-LED NAIROBI PROCESS, H.E KENYATTA, CONVENES A MEETING ON CANTONMENT MATTERS OF NORTH KIVU.

NAIROBI 30th June, 2023 (OFPP): His Excellency President (Rtd) Uhuru Kenyatta, in his capacity as the Facilitator of the East Africa Community (EAC)-led Nairobi Peace Process, today held a consultative meeting with various stakeholders on the cantonment matters in North Kivu in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

The meeting, which had the representation of the EAC member states, the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO), the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), international organizations, and members of the diplomatic corps, was aimed at assisting the stakeholders in planning, organizing, and reaching a consensus on how they can collectively work towards achieving the final stage of the process initiated during the Luanda Summit held on 23rd November 2022.

One of the primary objectives of the Nairobi & Luanda Peace Processes is an orderly and swift cessation of hostilities, involving the withdrawal of armed groups from their forward positions to designated locations and the systematic and organized cantonment and disarmament of the groups.

Addressing the delegates in Nairobi, the former Head of State underscored that the cantonment is a sensitive aspect of the peace restoration process that requires transparency, open consultation, and stakeholder dialogue.

""The cantonment aspect presents a sensitive and urgent challenge. We must ensure that all parties are adequately consulted and reach an agreement regarding this crucial stage. It is imperative to address all necessary technical and logistical matters, including establishing open and indirect lines of dialogue and consultation with the armed groups we aim to canton."" The facilitator said.

The Facilitator further stated that it is paramount that the cantonment stage succeeds if substantial progress in implementing the political and military objectives of sustainable peace and stability in the eastern part of the DRC.

The former President appreciated the leadership of the East Africa Community for their unwavering commitment and determination to assist the government of the DRC in pacifying the eastern region of the country.

He further commended the militaries and Chiefs of Defence Forces of the EAC countries for their close cooperation with EAC and the military authorities in the DRC, ensuring the proper and effective deployment of these forces across various sectors.

The Facilitator called on all stakeholders to work together to complete the cantonment process noting it will set the stage for subsequent activities within the framework of disarmament, demobilization, repatriation, reintegration, and resettlement (DDRRR) required in the future.

Speaking in the forum, the Special Representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations in DRC and Head of MONUSCO, Ms. Bintou Keita, echoed H.E Kenyatta's sentiments that the cantonment should be voluntary where she assured the forum of the United Nations unwavering support in the peace process.

The DRC Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs H.E. Christophe Lutundula Apala Pêne Apala, represented the government and assured the forum of the government's commitment to the peace process.

Other dignitaries in attendance included the EAC regional force commander (EACRF), Maj-Gen Alphaxard Muthuri Kiugu, Angolan Lieutenant-General Nassone João, among others. The EAC Secretary General (SG) was represented by the Military Advisor to the EAC SG, Major Gen. Ally Mzee Katimbe.",0.0,44.0,255.0,https://twitter.com/4thPresidentKE/status/1674876402120683522,2023-06-30 20:23:46+00:00,16157.0,

"Construction of the proposed 52km Ndunyu Njeru-Kahuruko-Ihithe Road (Mau Mau Road) is expected to reduce travel time and cost between Nyandarua and Nyeri Counties which have great potential for food crops and upgrading of the road will increase market access.

The proposed road is the most feasible option since the road user will drive through the section for 1 hour 30 minutes compared to the Ndunyu Njeru-Olkalau-Nyahururu-Ndaragwa-Nyeri town route (approximately 180km) which will take 3hours 17 minutes to drive.

Roads such as Thika-Flyover (Magumu) Road and Naivasha-Njabini-Gatura Road) have cut through forests and national reserves with no interference with ecosystems.

"KENYA HAILED FOR THE PRIMARY HEALTHCARE MODEL

The International Council of Nurses President Dr. Pamela Cypriano has hailed Kenya as a pacesetter for deploying the Primary Health Care model to ensure Universal Health Coverage. During my meeting with the President on the sidelines of the ongoing International Council of Nurses (ICN) Congress in Montreal Canada, she commended Kenya’s bold move saying Preventive and Promotive Health is the surest strategy to accelerate attainment of UHC.

In our mission to enhance the nursing Standards in the country we will engage with associations like ICN to ensure our nurses get exposure to global best practices. Nurses are the engines of healthcare service provision and we endeavor promote nursing as a profession and ensure they have a voice in healthcare policy and decision-making processes at the national and regional levels.

We also welcome collaborations that support the professional development of Kenyan Nurses through various capacity-building initiatives such as the Global Nursing Leadership institute (GNLI) program from which Kenya has benefited to have at least 8 alumni.

At the moment Kenya is engaged in Organizational Development of National Nursing Associations (ODENNA). a partnership of National Nurses Associations (NNA’s) in the African region designed to strengthen NNA’s ability to influence health outcomes, build respect, recognition and support profession.

We pledge to support such initiative and also continue to collaborate with ICN and the World Health Organization (WHO) to build capacity through training programs workshops, and educational resources to enhance nursing skills, knowledge, and leadership Capabilities.

We are looking forward to further engage on opportunities and network to enhance capacity building in the country. We are keen to engage WHO on campaign of 25:25:25 which aims to have 25% of health workforce trained in 25 countries by 2025.

We appreciate the partnerships to address common challenges, share best practices, and promote collaboration in areas such as education, research, and policy development, provision of  platforms  such as the ICN Congress that facilitate knowledge exchange.",15.0,22.0,145.0,https://twitter.com/muthonikenya/status/1676007612884688896,2023-07-03 23:18:48+00:00,16087.0,

"A second Consultative Technical Team meeting involving various stakeholders of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo Peace Process was held on Wednesday, the 12th, 2023, in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), to discuss various issues highlighted in the Luanda and Nairobi processes. 

The closed-door session majorly discussed matters of cantonment and confidence-building measures among the warring parties in the eastern part of DRC. 

In his opening remarks, the Facilitator said the meeting, unlike others held outside DRC, had been convened in Goma as an indication of all stakeholders' commitment to helping the Congolese people find lasting peace solutions to the conflict.

""The peace process is about the Congolese people, and therefore being in Goma instead of meeting in capitals outside of DRC is an indication of each and everyone's commitment to finding a lasting peaceful solution to the problems that have afflicted this part of our neighboring country,"" he said.

The Facilitator recognized the importance of all stakeholders working together as a team to find a peaceful resolution for the people of DRC. He appealed to all the armed groups to cease hostilities and give dialogue a chance.

Leading the delegation of the DRC government was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, H.E Jean-Pierre Bemba, who joined the forum virtually and weighed in on the deliberations. He reassured the platform of the government's commitment to both the Luanda and the Nairobi Peace Processes. The President's Special envoy Prof. Serge Tshibangu, the Minister of State for Regional Integration, Hon. Mbusa Nyamwisi, and the North Kivu Governor, Gen. Ndima Kongba, echoed his sentiments.

Representatives of MONUSCO, led by Ms. Bintou Keita, reiterated their commitment to finding lasting peace in the war-torn Region. 

Other organizations in attendance were East African Community (EAC), African Union (A.U.), The International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), observers from various international organizations, and some members of the diplomatic Corps. The EAC Regional Force Commander Maj-Gen Alphaxard Kiugu, the MUNUSCO Ag. Force Commander Maj - Gen Benoìt Chavant and Col Timoteo Neves of the Adhoc Verification Mechanism were also in attendance.

Later the Facilitator, accompanied by the head of MONUSCO, Ms. Bintou Keita, Hon. Mbusa Nyamwisi, and other stakeholders handling issues concerned with Gender-Based Violence, who joined the meeting virtually, met with a group of women leaders who shared their concerns on the plight of women and children at the IDP camps. They requested the Facilitator to look into these issues urgently and rally allies who can participate in women empowerment activities within the camps. They sighted the lack of economic empowerment as one of the issues that left women and children vulnerable in the camps. 

H.E Kenyatta assured the women that, as the Facilitator of the EAC - led Nairobi Peace Process, he acknowledged the concerns raised and assured them of his support. He also urged the women to come together and develop mechanisms on how they, too, can play a part in finding peace.  

""Women equally have a responsibility to work closely with us, to help establish a peaceful environment. They need to be our key agents of selling the language of peace as they are the greatest beneficiaries once that peace is established"", the Facilitator emphasized. 

The Facilitator thanked the organizations working closely with the women and children, urging them to ensure they are protected and catered for relentlessly.",0.0,62.0,369.0,https://twitter.com/4thPresidentKE/status/1679457658137456645,2023-07-13 11:48:03+00:00,20575.0,

"I strongly condemn in the strongest terms possible, the Azimio demonstrations which have been greatly linked with violence, destruction of property, looting, disruption of business as well as school activities, injuries and loss of lives.

It's appropriate to have an effective opposition which counter checks the government, this is aimed at achieving good governance, but not an opposition which directs its efforts on sabotaging the government's plans and efforts in mitigating our country's current issues and provision of long-term solutions to address our ailing matters as a country.

Demonstrations associated with causing mayhem, destruction of infrastructure as well as personal property and looting can only put our economy at risk and worsen our current situation as a nation, since the government's efforts geared towards reviving our economy and enhancing overall development in our country won't be productive.

As leaders, we should always be honest with ourselves if we are to effectively and diligently serve the people we represent. It will therefore be quite wrong and unfair for some leaders to let their personal interests prevail, at the expense of the lives for majority of Kenyans.

Kindly pleading with all the youth across our country, to distance themselves from such demonstrations and avoid being misled by some leaders with personal vested interests, as we provide the government with humble time to implement its manifesto, which is aimed at positively transforming livelihoods.

What time had hidden from me then, was the capacity and influence my service would have on the people of Kanyipir and beyond. I knew I would go places, but I didn't know I would bring the President of the Republic of Kenya to this little known place. Home.

My heart swells and pours out with humility to the clerics and clan; family, friends and colleagues who congregated with us today at Oriwo Boys' High School, for my Homecoming and Thanksgiving Ceremony.

The warm reception and surge of exuberance with which you received our guests, particularly President @WilliamsRuto and his Deputy H.E. @rigathi, EGH, was exceptional.

I don't know any other way to register my deepest expression of gratitude, but I will be here. To serve God, Home and Country.

Erourukamano!

Here, he had married and raised a family. And, he had sired children who knew no other home but this. This little hill of ash.

As Chief, he had intervened and mediated and presided over a lot of progressive courses. Championed for education and chaired committees over a number of fund drives, to either build schools or settle fee not only for the needy but gifted learners. 

Here, he had settled cases of domestic strife. Saw to it that some wives didn't leave their husbands and vice versa. Many marriages stood the test of time with the blessings of his beret. Right here. Under these trees, now burnt to sorry sticks.

As a disciplinarian, he ensured many children were put through school. Coerced lazy parents and made it impossible for mischievous kids to drop out of school. All these, for a better society. Right here, adult and child alike were reprimanded for their wrongdoings.

Passionately, he fought the ills and moral maladies that threatened to cripple the wheel of growth. Reduced the percentage of teen pregnancies, alcohol and other drug addiction. Right here, policies were formulated and plans hatched to punish vice. To reward virtue.

This home was a spring that nourished the lives of many. This home that now stands in a pile of ash and wreck. Razed down by a fire ignited by the same hands he held. Torched by the same people he tried to rehabilitate.

Even if we didn't mean to thank him for all the efforts he made to make us, couldn't we just then let him be?

At his age, what does he go back to? Where should he start?

It's not even the mould of debris that hurts. It is that, like a good chief's home, this was a place of refuge for many a tormented souls.",872.0,298.0,796.0,https://twitter.com/ray_omollo/status/1683177565731561472,2023-07-23 18:09:38+00:00,303566.0,

We have come as ordinary Kenyans to kneel and pray to a God whose promise of justice has been proven to stand over the ages.
The people we have lost and those nursing injuries had no capacity to overthrow a government. They had no capacity to own guns. They lacked the very basic of the basics; unga, sugar, milk, school fees, bus fare, and rent. They ended up taking bullets.
We mourn with those families. We promise to help. And we promise to pursue justice.
As we strive to make sense out of senseless tragedy, we need to ask ourselves basic questions. Chief among them: Has Kenya Kwanza suspended the Constitution? If you suspend any Article, including Article 37, you have effectively suspended the Constitution. 
The events of these past days need to make us to reflect on the present and the future, on the way we want to run this country and the way we want to be governed.
Today, even as we continue to mourn, celebrate, and pray for the victims, we are going a step further and launching the Citizens’ Emergency Fund to offer practical support to families of the dead and the injured. My brothers Uhuru Kenyatta and @RailaOdinga have already contributed Shs. 1 million each. I have escorted them with Shs. 500,000 and Members of Parliament have contributed Shs. 1.5 million.

2. My engineers have designed an alternative footbridge that pedestrians and bikes will be using at the correct place. We commence immediately. 

3. The sewer pouring into the drainage (its not the river) is as a result of illegal farming where farmers infiltrate the sewer blocking it so as to use the spillage for their farms. 🤮  our Engineers are unblocking the sewer line and we will deal with those  perpetrating the illegality. 

4. We have agreed with the residents that once the bridge is complete the Trunk Sewer will no longer be used as a path.

"Went to Njiru Ward at the site of the infamous ""bridge"" that's been highlighted on social media. 

1. It's an old trunk sewer that's been used for decades by residents to cross. It shouldn't be used as a bridge. 

2. My engineers have designed an alternative footbridge that pedestrians and bikes will be using at the correct place. We commence immediately. 

3. The sewer pouring into the drainage (its not the river) is as a result of illegal farming where farmers infiltrate the sewer blocking it so as to use the spillage for their farms. 🤮  our Engineers are unblocking the sewer line and we will deal with those  perpetrating the illegality. 

4. We have agreed with the residents that once the bridge is complete the Trunk Sewer will no longer be used as a path.

2. My engineers have designed an alternative footbridge that pedestrians and bikes will be using at the correct place. We commence immediately. 

3. The sewer pouring into the drainage (its not the river) is as a result of illegal farming where farmers infiltrate the sewer blocking it so as to use the spillage for their farms. 🤮  our Engineers are unblocking the sewer line and we will deal with those  perpetrating the illegality. 

4. We have agreed with the residents that once the bridge is complete the Trunk Sewer will no longer be used as a path.
