October 1st,2023

WHERE SHOULD THE AFCON MATCHES BE HELD IN KENYA?

This is a joint statement by Kisumu Governor, H.E Prof Peter Anyang' Nyong'o and Kakamega Governor, H.E   FCPA Ferdinand Baraza concerning the hosting of the Africa Cup of Nations in the three East African countries in 2027.

The UDA government has announced that the AFCON 2027 football matches shall be held in Nairobi and Eldoret.

This, in our view, is a tragic decision. Western Kenya should have been included with either matches being held in Kisumu or Kakamega. 
The Western region of Kenya is where football fans exist in plenitude. NOT in Uashin Gishu, or Eldoret for that matter.

The success of the matches will be on the turn up at the stadia where the matches will be held. 
Eldoret has athletes and athletic fans in millions. But not soccer. And that is the naked truth. This means the Afcon matches will be played in empty stadia with very little impact.

The decision by the UDA government may be denying the Western region the opportunity to host the games because we are not shareholders in the Kenya Kwanza Company limited.

That would be extremely myopic as the President was representing the Republic of Kenya when he teamed with our colleagues in the East African Community. Coming back home, he seems to have changed the goal post. That's unfortunate.
It  should be noted that our neighbors who are cohosting the tournament with us, under the PAMOJA proposal, have each chosen three venues namely: Uganda-Kampala, Lira and Hoima; Tanzania-Dar e Salaam, Zanzibar and Arusha. Why can’t we do the same in Kenya?

There is still time to reconsider the decision. The people of Western Kenya are waiting.

Kisumu County joined the rest of the world in commemorating world rabies day at Pap Kadundo, Seme Sub County.

Statistics shows that the prevalence of this disease in about 150 countries worldwide is killing 60,000 people annually.

Therefore with renewed vigor and commitment to eradicate the disease, under this year's theme is ""All for 1; one health for all"" has highlighted issues that would lead to complete eradication of the disease.

The eradication measures include: education, surveillance, data sharing, mass vaccination , timely pre and post exposure treatment, keeping dogs at home not roaming freely, collaboration and timely diagnosis will lead to one health for everyone.

Statistics show that within the years  2019 to 2023, Kisumu reported 1,640 cases of dog bites, of which 30 were confirmed rabies cases while 10 people lost their lives.

Within the same period the County  Government in it's commitment to eradicate rabies,  procured 63,060 doses of anti rabies vaccines to a tune of13,873,200million 

Through championing collaborations with partners and upscaling investments in the war to eradicate rabies, Zipline Company using drone technology,  has reduced time wastage and delays in health product supply just as was witnessed today as it delivered rabies vaccines at Pap Kadundo during the event.

Being cognizant to ""one health for all"" slogan, an intersectoral multidisciplinary approach has been instituted to harness cooperation of professional teams for human, animal and environment health sectors to  enhance mitigation of zoonotic disease management.

The County Minister for Agriculture, Hon. Ken Onyango reiterated that preventing diseases before they occur will mean a heathier and more productive population and lower health management cost.

His clarion call to the pet owners is to promote responsible animal and pet keeping as they play their role in eradicating rabies.

Members of the Press,
 
We have no alternative as a leadership from a County that bore the brunt of the recent street protests against the cost of living, but must continue with the on-going  uncompromising bipartisan talks. We have  been following closely the on-going dialogue talks between the Kenya Kwanza and Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Alliance and must remind all of the thorns, stones, teargas and roadblocks to the bipartisan action.
 
We are aware that the talks have been facing some challenges ostensibly on the constitution of the Independent Electoral Boundaries Commission among other issues,but remain focused on the intent and content of the dialogue. We have come a long way as a country from the dark moments of our history and must as a people continue to struggle unwaveringly against all forces of obscurantism. 

We believe that no Kenyan citizen has to endure subhuman living conditions. Every Kenyan must have adequate food, descent shelter and clothing, adequate health, security and gainful employment. It is your right to enjoy minimum  standards of human existence. The satisfaction of basic needs is a human right at per with the right to life.   
 
After deep consultations and soul-searching, we wish to state as follows:
 
1:  That as one of the governors whose County bore the brunt of the protests including deaths, we support the dialogue and would like it to continue to a successful conclusion as per the wishes of our Party Leader PM Rt. Hon. Raila Amollo Odinga.

2:  That we appeal to the  negotiators and our leaders to give the talks a chance to help resolve issues that resulted into the demonstrations.

3:  That we assure our party leader that as leadership of the county, we support his decision to engage in dialogue and ask him count on our support.

4.  That we are aware that some leaders across the country would like the dialogue to collapse so that the country relapses back into political and economic chaos and turmoil. We should avoid such paths that will lead to more misery for the masses.

5.  That we would like to warn such leaders who have been blowing hot and cold about the talks that Kenyans will judge them harshly should the bipartisan dialogue collapse. Let what is on the table be what is under the table.

6.  That we remind leaders from both sides that time is running out and that  the faster we conclude these talks  the better for the country. Let us tone down on hardliner attitudes and embrace dialogue.

7.  That we must stay together for when we divert our focus, we will never succeed  and come out of the quagmire we are in as a country. We should never allow selfishness, egotistic and chauvinistic ways replace the cause we have believed in for so long. It is only the bipartisan talks that will get the country out of the current muddle and allow it to forge ahead with the business of development and Nation building. 

Thank you all.",

It was a day filled with important events that will undoubtedly enhance the safety and welfare of our community.

We began the day by Commissioning Biashara Location Chief's camp. Subsequently, we took the opportunity to tour Thika Traffic Police Office & Thika Industrial Area Police Patrol. These visits allowed us to assess the facilities, resources, and the overall working conditions of our law enforcement officers. We discussed strategies to improve their capabilities and enhance their service to our community.

Later, the CS himself wielded the shovel and broke ground for the construction of a new Thika West Sub-County Police Divisional Headquarters in Ngoingwa. Thika NG-CDF has committed 10Million Shillings to kick start this project and I'm thankful to the CS for generously contributing an additional 10 million Shillings. The state-of-the-art facility will provide our police officers with the tools they need to serve and protect our community effectively.

In addition to this incredible news, the CS did not mince words when addressing the issue of land cartels. Hao ata wao wameambiwa mambo ni matatu..

Across the country, families are mourning and preparing to burry loved one who were victims of murderous police officers. Many families are in hospitals nursing loved ones who were injured by police. Tens of people have been hospitalized with gunshots and arrow and panga wounds. 

Some of the victims are young school boys and girls who were not even involved in demonstrations. Hundreds of people are also being detained in police cells or have been arraigned in court for participating in a process that is protected by the constitution. Among those in police custody is our able member of parliament for Mavoko Hon. Patrick Makau. 

We demand immediate and unconditional dropping of all charges against Hon. Makaua all those who were arrested for participating in a constitutionally protected action of protesting against punitive policies. 

We are here today to condemn the senseless brutality and Statesanctioned execution of civilians by police which is becoming the new normal in Kenya. We are deeply concerned at the repeated instances of police brutality against innocent and law abiding civilians. 

Yesterday, this brutality gained a higher notoriety. Police not only fired bullets at citizens who were gathering for a rally in Kamkunji, far from the Central Business District. They also fired teargas into a primary school in Kawangware, exposing to mortal danger innocent children who had absolutely no idea what was going on around them. 

The brutality is not ad hoc. It is coordinated and ethicized. A special ethnic-based killer squad has been formed within the police service to brutalize and carry out summary execution of civilians in the name of protecting what they have been made to believe is their regime. 

This squad is taking instructions from an equally ethnic-based command structure that operates outside the official channels of the Police Service. 

As if this is not bad enough, a killer squad that is not part of the police service is being activated to operate as part of police to brutalize Kenyans. This squad was in its true element yesterday, firing at protesters from unmarked vehicles that we know belong to police in places like Mlolongo and Kitengela. 

There were murders, injuries and arrests in as diverse places including Machakos, Kisumu, Kisii, Busia, Wote, Emali, Meru and Kilifi, among other places. We are in the process of compiling complete data from across the nation on the victims of this operation and will share the same with the country in due course. 

These acts of brutality are running side by side with politically supported acts of ethnic profiling in parts of the country where ethnic-based militias are being formed and facilitated to attack other communities with crude weapons, with the support of State. It is happening in parts of Nyanza along the Kisii/Kericho and Kisumu/ Kericho borders. It is happening here in Nairobi too. 

Someone is working on a script of ethnic profiling, antagonism and murder much similar to what was witnessed here in 1991-92, 1997 and 200-2008. The world has known of the Butcher of Cambodia before, among other butchers. Today, it would appear a Butcher of Kenya is in the making. 

We call on Kenyans to refuse to be intimidated in their own country. We urge Kenyans to be firm and resist this deliberate effort to turn the National Police Service into a killer squad for hire by politicians and regime suffering acute legitimacy deficit. We are going beyond merely condemning this emerging pattern. 

We have instructed our lawyers to prepare and institute legal proceedings against police officers who have gone against their duty of protecting life and property of Kenyans and instead become a threat to citizens. 

In this regard, we are appealing to all Kenyans who have photographic or video evidence of police brutalizing citizens to share the same with us to aid the case that our legal team is working on. 

Going forward, we appeal to Kenyans to resort to citizen journalism and photograph and film State officers, including police and politicians who, in the course of duty, abuse and brutalize citizens. 

Because the regime has decided to turn all institutions of the State against the citizens, we have no option but to act to protect ourselves. 

We are going for individual responsibility and culpability against officers. We are also going for individual culpability against police commanders whom we have reason to believe know or ought to have known about the illegal actions of the officers under their command. We stand in solidarity with the victims of this police brutality and their families. 

We will offer support to offset costs and help lessen the burden on the families. We have made a decision to observe five days of mourning and solidarity with the victims and their families during which we will try our level best to mobilize support to help lessen the burden on the families of victims. 

But we are not giving up in our quest to force Mr. William Ruto to lower the cost of living, commit to the audit of the 2022 election, bipartisan reconstitution of the IEBC and respect political parties. 

Consequently, we announce that our protests will resume on Wednesday, 19th July 2023. 

In the meantime, we proceed with the collection of signatures against Ruto on both digital and manual platforms. 

We notice the Communication Authority has joined the war against Kenyans by trying to cripple our digital signature collection platform, but we will fight and soldier on while we put the CA on notice. 

There is no looking back. There is no turning back. See you on Wednesday.",

Last week, we announced the launch of a program of collecting signatures for purposes of taking back the powers we delegated to our leaders. The exercise, which is ongoing, is meant to express people’s displeasure with Ruto and the raft of punitive, unfair and unjust taxes that he has decided to impose on the people, without the people’s consent.

This is part of the campaign of resistance, the civil disobedience and citizens’ actions that we have decided to pursue to force Ruto and his regime to respect and listen to the people.

The Finance Act 2023 clearly exposed the fact that our leaders have decided to take instructions from the Executive and the Executive has decided to pursue its own wishes, regardless of what the people feel or say. Both the legislature and the Executive have ganged up against the people, and the people have been left on their own. In return, the people have decided, rightly, to gang up against the Executive and the Legislature. The people have decided to invoke Article 1 of the Constitution.

The process we are engaging in is about the deliberate policy decisions by the Kenya Kwanza regime to make life unbearable to a great majority of Kenyans despite the consistent appeal by Kenyans for the regime to take actions to lessen their burden.

The digital platform we have unveiled today, is complementary to all other efforts and platforms including civil disobedience, tax boycotts and defiance that are meant to compel the regime to repeal the Finance Act 2023 and take deliberate steps to lower the cost of living.

These actions are also meant to compel the regime to address all the weighty issues that we have been pushing for, including a bipartisan reconstitution of the IEBC, audit of the 2022 elections and an end to the invasion and compromising of parties and MPs.

The digital platform we have unveiled today will therefore run alongside manual or physical signature collection, and we urge Kenyans to feel free to choose between digital and manual platforms; whichever they are comfortable with.

We are aware that Kenya Kwanza has questioned where we will take the signatures and the legality of the exercise. We don’t expect them to understand. They don’t understand the people’s power as of now, but with time, they will. But they need to understand we will not take it to the Kenya Kwanza IEBC or their compromised Parliament. We take this early opportunity to thank the 1.2 million people who have signed so far. We appeal to more people to come out and append their signatures to this historic undertaking.

As we launch this, our citizens’ engagement forums that we started in Kamkunji last week will continue. And Kamkunji will not be confined to Nairobi. As the people demonstrated last week, Kamkunji will be everywhere and anywhere across the country where Kenyans gather in the name of justice and well-being.

We sincerely thank the people who turned out and spoke loudly, boldly and fearlessly in Western, Coast, Central, Nyanza, Eastern, North Eastern, Rift Valley and of course, Nairobi last week.

We take note that in the course of our otherwise peaceful activities across the country, Kenya Kwanza responded with live bullets and killed people in various parts of the country. In Nairobi, there was an attempt to assassinate the Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga.

We know they are getting it very wrong and missing the point that what Kenyans have started is a self-propelling movement. It has never been and it will never be about an individual. Just like the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. or the detention of Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi did not stop the march for civil rights and freedom in the US, South Africa and India, no amount of shooting, teargas or even assassination will stop the march of history in this country.

However, we intend to move to court and institute prosecution against individual officers who are involved in unconstitutional and illegal actions against protesters in the course of our activities.

Our activities are protected by the Constitution. By resorting to civil disobedience and protests, we can’t be wrong unless the law itself is wrong. Kenyans must never be made to believe that they are wrong when they protest.

We therefore ask Kenyans to film, photograph and record all those police officers who shoot at or in any other way hurt protesters in the course of our activities. Such officers are acting in disregard of the constitution and we must make them pay for their illegal activities.

We are back tomorrow, at Kamkunji in Nairobi and Kamkunjis elsewhere across the country.

Once again, we appeal to Kenyans to come out in even bigger numbers and make their voices heard. With time, Ruto will respect Kenyans.

What we started last week was only the first wave. Tomorrow, we must return with an even greater force and in greater numbers. And we must keep doing this until Ruto listens to and respects Kenyans.

Finally, and most importantly, let us stay united.

We need unity now more than ever.

With unity, the fight won’t be long and we will get many of the things we desire and deserve.

Let us stick together until the end.

See you in Kamkunji tomorrow.",

July 4, 2023

Ladies and Gentlemen,

We gather here today because THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD ENOUGH. There comes a time when being taken for granted becomes unbearable. There comes a time when being treated as fools becomes intolerable. That time has come.

Henceforth, we are taking bold measures against the illegitimate regime of Ruto, in response to his actions against us. Ruto is imposing taxes without our consent and implementing laws that only make our lives more difficult. We cannot tolerate the current state of taxation and its accompanying injustices any longer. Ruto has even removed subsidies on essential goods like fuel, unga (maize flour), electricity, and school fees, while providing subsidies to helicopter owners and financing the lavish lifestyles of his allies with our hard-earned money.

It is evident that we are dealing with a heartless tyrant who shows no regard for the people. We are determined to rectify this situation. Therefore, we are here to announce that our Kamukunji meeting will take place in Nairobi this Friday, as previously announced. However, this is not just a gathering in Nairobi; it is a nationwide Kamukunji where we will launch the Third Liberation. On July 7th, 2023, we will initiate signature collection campaigns to express our rejection of the illegitimate Kenya Kwanza regime and its punitive tax policies.

As we speak, the prices of fuel, food, and transportation are skyrocketing. In fact, fare has already increased by 30 percent. Fellow Kenyans, as a resilient people, we refuse to suffer in silence. We do not bow down to dictators and beg for mercy. Even those who do still face humiliation and even death. So, we fight.

We raise our voices loudly and clearly on issues that affect us. Therefore, we must fight, and our fight begins on Friday. Unity is crucial now more than ever. Together, we can achieve not only our desires but also what we rightfully deserve. From Friday onwards, let us move forward with unwavering determination, standing united and working together until the end.

Violence is abhorrent to us. Our engagement in pickets, protests, tax boycotts, and civil disobedience does not advocate violence. We have never endorsed violence in the past, and we never will. We firmly believe in the law and the rule of law, and we will act within its boundaries. Our sole weapon is our sovereign power to protest, boycott, and engage in civil disobedience. We exercise this power starting on Friday, July 7th.

Fellow Kenyans, we want you to understand that WE ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE. We are not wrong. By resorting to civil disobedience and protests, we cannot be wrong unless the law itself is wrong. The same law that establishes the government and its institutions, such as parliament, the courts, and the police, also permits us to protest, picket, boycott, and present petitions. We are within our rights, and we refuse to be intimidated.

Let us remember the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who once said, ""Now it means sacrificing, yes, it means sacrificing at points. But there are some things that we've got to learn to sacrifice for. And we've got to come to the point that we are determined not to accept a lot of things that we have been accepting in the past."" As a country, we have reached that point. We invite all our fellow citizens to prepare to join the Kamukunji in Nairobi and other locations across the country on Friday.

Thank you, Kenyans. Let us gather in Kamukunji and various parts of the country for the Saba Saba of our lifetime.",

The Central Organization of Trade Unions, COTU (K) takes this early opportunity to thank and applaud His Excellency the President for listening to the Workers’ calls and appointing a full Cabinet Secretary in charge of the Ministry of Labour as a stand-alone Ministry as opposed to the previous arrangement where the Ministry had been merged with the affairs of East African community.  

This decision by the President to have the Labour Ministry distinct is bound to have huge and positive impact not only to the country’s Industrial Relations’ Management but equally create a conducive environment where the Ministry will fully discharge off only Labour Matters  allowing the Cabinet Secretary to concentrate on the same and equally the appointment of Hon. Ukur Yattani is applaudable considering his vast experience as a Governor and Administrator and as workers we welcome the appointment.

At the same time COTU (K) thanks the President for considering the appointment of the Former Chairman of the Federation of Kenya Employers, FKE and lately the Cabinet Secretary for Health Hon. Cleopa Maillu as the Head of UN Mission in Geneva which combines its duties with the International Labour Organisation, (ILO) Issues and as a previous key player in the tripartism arrangement, COTU (K) has no doubt that he will deliver on this mandate

We appealed to the two political sides-NASA and jubilee- to embrace dialogue even before election in August 2017.

We foresaw the current political stand-off but we were ignored.

I was even accused of belonging to NASA and had been promised a cabinet post should Raila be president.

Dialogue does not mean Uhuru or Raila will cede their positions but Kenya is bigger than all of us.

The hard-line positions being exhibited by both sides is putting majority of Kenyans and workers in problems should their be any form of violence.

I don't meant to say that NASA and jubilee should share power but we need to have a stable political environment.

We would rather as a country have a bad government than no government at all.

 Look at Libya after Gadaffi, look at Somalia after the collapse of Siade Barre's government, they have no country.

Uhuru should not completely ignore the opposition. The effects of bad politics is  for instance  being felt in Nairobi CBD- people are being mugged in broad daylight.

People are dissulusiomed and their are signs of hopelessness in many faces of Kenyans.

Our records at COTU show that we have lost more than 100,000 jobs because of the current political stand-off.

During the struggle for Independence, Masinde was convinced that the white man deployed religion as a tool for manipulation of the black man, effectively using it to colonise the minds of the native population. 

He therefore decided that true liberation could only come from complete freedom from colonialism, including religious freedom. He subsequently founded the Dini Ya Msambwa in 1948, to advocate for indigenous African worship devoid of the white man’s domination. 

The sect became popular among the locals as it incorporated cultural and traditional customs in prayer, while also acting as a freedom struggle movement for the emancipation of the black man.

While engaging in anti-colonial activities, Masinde came into contact with white rulers a lot. Confrontations abounded. At one time, he had a physical fight with a colonial administrator for refusing to kneel before him.

Masinde was later arrested and detained several times, in different locations, including at Kapenguria. He became a thorn in the flesh of colonial administrators for preaching the liberation message in prison, forcing them to move him from location to location to arrest what they considered his indoctrination of prisoners.

He closely identified with Jomo Kenyatta’s struggles and encouraged Kenyatta to be radical, as that was the language the white man would understand. He also closely identified with Jaramogi Oginga Odinga’s philosophy of “full independence can only mean political, economic, educational and religious independence”, harping on this to encourage native populations to form business thrift units so that when independence came, it would find a ready population.

Because of his radical message and insistence on both religious and economic freedom as part of the 1963 independence package, he was subsequently detained by the Kenyatta government after independence, spending time in jail until 1978, when he was released as part of Moi’s amnesty to political prisoners. This radicalism wouldn’t relent, forcing Moi to send him back to jail briefly.

He died in 1987 but his contribution remains largely unrecognized, an error I’m hoping the National Heroes Council will finally correct.",

The infamous Turkwel-Ortum-Kitale line is one of them. The other one is the evacuation of geothermal to the coast region. Whereas it appears like common sense to prioritize these lines, attention is focused elsewhere because those projects are not “fatty” enough.

At the Energy Committee we were able to see through all the Kizungu mingi you hear from KPLC, the CS Energy, and IPP’s of sijui “grid stabilization” “base load” and “peaking plants”. Its all one choreographed robbery syndicate and because we are already legally committed with contracts of up-to 30 years, there is little in terms of what can be done now. Infact we were told its cheaper for Kenyans to pay for expensive power than touch those contracts and go the South Africa Way. Nimemaliza.",

CPAC managed to stop KRA from imposing hefty penalties on counties for late remittance of statutory deductions.
We also managed to save the County of Nairobi Sh16 Billion, when the leadership of NMS agreed that the pending bills were going to be settled by the National Government.

We remember the contributions of among others, Archbishops Raphael Ndingi Mwana a'Nzeki, John Henry Okullu and Alexander Kipsang Muge, in this regard.

Today, the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops has issued a statement over the ongoing crisis in the country, which, if not addressed urgently by the authorities, poses an existential threat to the unity and survival of Kenya. I laud the Bishops for exercising the courage to speak up, when the more convenient default setting for other religious leaders, is to maintain a sturdy silence in the face of oppression and decline of the national fabric. 

I especially fully identify with these key issues posited in their statement;

1. That the Finance Act remains an oppressive, insensitive and ill-advised law, which should be repealed to lift the economic burden off the backs of a distressed citizenry.

2. That police brutality must end! The arming of uniformed Kenyans against the innocent unarmed citizens, constitutes a crime against humanity and perpetrators need to know that in the fullness of time, they will be held individually accountable.

3. That the government must listen to the plight of Kenyans. It is inconceivable for this regime to both purport to claim legitimacy to govern, while at the same time turning a deaf ear to the plight of the people, as it actively impoverishes and brutalises them.

I have asked, on different fora, for the Ruto regime to find someone, anyone, it can listen to, if we in Azimio are, in their view, mere purveyors of nuisance. It is not possible for everyone to be wrong and only this fraudulent regime right. Here is another opportunity to listen to people who are apolitical and hold a special place in the nation as intercessors between the population and God. 

As a baptised and practicing Catholic, may I express utmost pride in my church and its leadership today. In times of oppression, there is never a middle ground. You are either with the oppressed or the oppressor. In unequivocally making this firm statement, the Catholic church has admirably shown which side it will take if impunity becomes a way of life. I urge members of the National Police Service, majority of whom are Catholics, to heed the sound advice of our Bishops and stop brutalising fellow Kenyans.

As for this confused government, I can only finish with the famous African saying that the ears that refuse to listen to advice, soon accompany the head when it is chopped.",

My experience with the bees of the traditional beekeepers of Kipkunur Honey Processors was so therapeutic!

Slide 1: This is what they use to smoke the bees

Slide 2: The dried skin pouch they use to collect honey. This is so much better than using a plastic bucket. I wanted one for myself!

Slide 3: Sema kufunikwa! The traditional log hive was surrounded by some more wood and mabati to protect it from rain and extreme weather patterns which is good. But it was very hard to open and was harbouring sonmany pests that could easily affect the hive. So it needs to be done in a better way...maybe just building a cover over the hive...

We WILL support you!
Training is so important because most traditional beekeepers have such strong colonies (families of bees in hives), but there are also a lot of myths and misconceptions about beekeeping that we need to demystify, and new practices we need to adopt 

Fact: In Kenya, we import 85% of our honey. And why should we when we have so much organic, natural honey?
Slowly but surely, we are creating well informed and trained communities of beekeepers to deal with this

I had a lot of fun walking in our mature sunflower fields and it was so therapeutic to watch my bees forage on the sunflowers.

I also believe in the collaborative efforts of both men and women in beekeeping, as we all bring different strengths to the table

I loved the insights that he shared on how we can improve our honey processing unit and his overall appreciation of the work that we do.

I also made sure he got into a beesuit to see the bees because I knew due to the policy work he does it had been a minute

(Wewe ulikuwa unajua juu ya hii ofisi?😌). 

The Office renders a free service that helps Kenyans both in the public and private sector get their rights. It ensures compliance with the integrity requirements in the law by public officers. It also oversees the implementation of the Access to Information Act, 2016. This free service shoulders Kenyans from having to go to court and incur a lot of legal fees to settle some matters.

I am so proud of the achievements that Cmmr. Washington Sati, MBS, the Vice Chairperson of the Commission, has achieved thus far. As a member and frontliner for advocacy in the deaf community; he has scaled the heights of success and garnered expertise in gender, disability, governance and human rights with a specialisation in social, political and economic rights. 

I loved getting to know of his pursuit of greatness through his educational and career journey; which was topped by my now favourite story of how he met and asked his wife out☺️. #KenyanSignLanguage #DeafCommunityInKenya #LearnSign",

In March/April I organised a training for about 20 of my neighbours in Beekeeping. We only managed to do the theory so we are now going progressively to each of their farms to do the practical and help them check on their hives 

Slide 1: Preparation is everything. Making sure everyone is well suited up and the random things you see around (our tools) that make our work efficient and effective 

Slide 2: It's interesting that Beekeeping is male dominated. I have to date met only one female beekeeper. I do agree a part of the work is Labour intensive...I wonder why else

Slide 3: Carefully arranging the bars in the  hives after cleaning 

Slide 4: Trying to coach my cousin on how I want the video to be taken 🤣
But most importantly...was asking because he was first checking the super (where the bees make the honey) and was asking if we will check the main box (Brood box) where they lay their eggs (kama main house) 
The excitement the men had in seeing their male counterparts (drones)!

Slide 5: I was shocked that these very active bees hadn't finished filling the main house (Brood box) calculating also the date the farmer told me he installed the hives. But also the bees maybe colonised the hive recently 

Slide 6: Cross combing is when the bees don't follow the straight line of the bars to make the honeycombs but then do it diagonally. There are many reasons they may have done so.
Cross combing makes it difficult to separate the bars during hive checks

As we mark Devolution’s 10th anniversary, we are celebrating the remarkable strides we have made so far in every sector of our economy.

To highlight a few, in Finance, County Govts have received a total of KES 2.9 trillion, that has effectively been used to significantly improve livelihoods. 

In Health, counties have progressively increased health allocation from at least 30% of their budgets- underscoring their commitment to the delivery of affordable, accessible and quality healthcare. 

In Agriculture, counties have made budgetary allocations aimed at reviving cash crop production and value addition. 

And finally, in Trade and Investment sector,in line with the President’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA), 
County Govts have now prioritized initiatives that seek to incentivize the growth of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). And the establishment of EPZs & CAIPS.
 
In all these sectors, there is very little debate about the results. Therefore it is with great pride that I declare the State of our Devolution is Strong. 

May the challenges we have surmounted and lessons learnt help us to even surpass our achievements going forward.

God bless Kenya!

The  people of Kenya and their government hereby express deepest sympathy and send condolences to the families of all victims. We also wish a speedy recovery to the injured.

Kenya strongly maintains that there exists no justification whatsoever for terrorism, which constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security.  All acts of terrorism and violent extremism are abhorrent, criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of the perpetrator, or their motivations. The international community must mobilise to bring the perpetrators, organizers, financiers, sponsors, supporters and enablers of these reprehensible criminal acts of terrorism to account and speedily bring them to justice.
 
In consideration of the complex and delicate context of the security situation in Israel-Palestine,  Kenya also makes a call for the de-escalation of violence and urges all parties to restrain from further military action, given its potential to intensify carnage and the suffering of innocent civilians, and to trigger heightened tension in the region and beyond. We are profoundly disturbed  that civilians continue to be intentionally targeted in this conflict, as a consequence of which the number of casualties continues to rise. We therefore call on all parties to respect the rights of civilians and honour their obligations under international law.

Finally, we take this opportunity to reiterate our firm stand in solidarity with all those calling on the parties to desist from further attacks, promptly effect cease-fire and embark on a path towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict.",

3. Develop the Human Evolution trail become a humanity pilgrimage. For Everyone in the world to touch and walk the path of their origin.

4. Make Kenya the hotbed of Archeological research.

5. Make Turkana the Global Capital of Humanity.

In Brief... here #SystemYaFacts..

The fact that pump prices have not changed today is consistent with the policy pronouncements of the Kenya Kwanza Administration.

1. What has been applied is stabilization not a subsidy. 

2. The Petroleum Development Levy (PDL)  was put in place to amongst other things cushion Kenyans from spikes in Petroleum Pump Prices.

The PDL is a fund for a rainy day such as this one. 

2. THE GOVERNMENT has not applied any EXCHEQUER funding which would be a SUBSIDY, but simply given back to Kenyans their money which we have collected from them in the past in the form of a levy.

3.  It is within the funds that have been collected and does not need any exchequer support as was the norm in the previous administration.

4. The Handshake regime  employed exchequer funds which made it a subsidy. The aim was singular to remain populist while avoiding the hard decisions of investing in Production. Even worse they did not pay for it, they left that burden to President Ruto to sort. Such was the don't care attitude!

5. Therefore the compensation is in the form of a stabilization fund anchored in law, it is not a subsidy.

Repeating a lie does not change the FACTS!

6.  If you look at the Kenya Kwanza manifesto - we committed to ring fencing the fund to cushion  pump Prices in a day like today.

Read the PLAN again and understand! 

Lakini of course, we know,  you would want us to sink to the low that was Handshake regime, but it will NOT happen, we are focused on investing in PRODUCTION!

The Ministry of Water, Sanitation, and Irrigation (MoWSI), with the support of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Water and Sanitation Development Partners Group, commissioned a water sector study ni July 2022 with the overarching objective of unlocking the local capital market to fund the
development of water and sanitation infrastructure in Kenya.

Following the completion of the study in February 2023, the MoWSI has commenced the process of presenting the findings and recommendations of the study for adoption by water sector stakeholders, the private sector, development partners, and other relevant actors.

During a workshop held at the Radison Blu Hotel today, i have; 

1. Asked the team to pick up momentum without a break so as to achieve the objectives & agenda.
2. Commited to provide a physical space and critical human resource that will constantly follow up on the agenda.
3. Encouraged water investment and assured investors that the government is committed to work together with investors through PPP’s including working on removing barriers and challenges that investors face.
4. Challenged different groups to challenge self beyond known parameters and also explore new market opportunities for water. 

This includes involving Local Women and Youths groups, Schools and institutions in running water resources such as boreholes  and other idle resources that are not yet utilized. 

I have also promised to follow up on filling in existing gaps that are a hinderance towards achieving the main agenda as policies are developed.

IMPORTANT TO NOTE

Capital Market Funds for the W&S sector does not have to affect public debt levels: through a non-recourse structure, failure to pay only leads to re-structuring/write off as lenders are looking to future cash flows by the WSP.

The long tenor of CMF lowers the annual debt service for a WSP, even if interest rates are high. It stretches the repayment obligation and more closely matches the useful life of the assets of WSPs in Kenya (20-30 years for civil works, and
7-8 years for mechanical and electrical works)

The discipline required to access CMF leads to performance improvement of WSPs: WSPs with good governance that show creditworthiness through improved operations can access CMF instruments

NAIROBI, 5th May 2023,– Former President Uhuru Kenyatta has mourned Mau Mau heroine Mukami Kimathi, describing her as an enduring symbol of Kenya’s  liberation struggle.

The former President said Mama Mukami, who passed on last night, continuously demonstrated the true spirit of patriotism and loyalty to the country.

“Throughout her life, Mama Mukami demonstrated what genuine patriotism means and how citizens  are supposed to  work towards the progress of their motherland.

“Indeed as a true patriot, she never failed to play her role  as a mentor and a leader worthy emulating,” said the former President.

The former Head of State pointed out that despite her health challenges in the recent past, Mama Mukami stood steadfastly not only for the welfare of her family but of the country as she continued to encourage those she interacted with to continue working for the good of the nation.

“Despite the health challenges which she experienced in her old age, Mama Mukami was always eager to support all leaders in finding tangible solutions to challenges facing the country.

“For those of us who had the privilege of interacting with her, we will forever cherish the moments we shared and thank God for having given us the opportunity to associate with such a great warrior,” he added.

The former Head of State called on all leaders to emulate Mama Mukami by fighting for the greater good of the nation.

He prayed to God to give the bereaved family the fortitude and strength to bear the loss as the country mourns the nation’s freedom heroine.",

-Reviewing of legal frameworks for the State Department so that the new policy that will be put in place ensures that the correctional facilities are modernized correctional centres instead of punishment areas.

-Improving on Staff and inmates welfare through provision of enough uniforms 

-Improving on the prison officers housing conditions

It is gratifying to note that EABL's interventions align with the flagships under the Agricultural Sector Transformation and Growth Strategy (ASTGS), the Government manifesto, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on zero hunger, decent work, and economic growth. These efforts demonstrate that private sector entities can deploy business strategies that go beyond profit maximization and respond to the challenges faced by communities at all levels.

Indeed, the training will go a long way in ensuring peacekeeping after they have been trained and gained skills in strategic guidance framework-related aspects, Nelson Mandela Rules, Bangkok Rules, report writing, mentoring and advising among others.

After undergoing through the training, we are confident that the graduants will go out there and work diligently with the purposes of serving the general public in line with the UN peace keeping missions.

In the UN Peace Keeping Missions, Corrections work closely with other national authorities to promote and prioritize the peaceful resolution and prevention of disputes, strengthen the protection of civilians, improve national security, restore and extend the authority of the State, restore trust and confidence, promote social cohesion, and contribute to the implementation of peace agreements.

MY LAST DAY TO VISIT STATIONS AT Ministry of Interior-State Department for Correctional Services

VISIT TO KERUGOYA AND MARANJAU GK PRISON

The government intends to modernize prisons equipment in the industries to increase on production within a very short time and to also focus is on making quality products. Visited Kerugoya GK Prison as part of the correctional facilities field visits to check on the status and welfare of the inmates and the Prison Officers with the aim of identifying loop holes and looking for ways to seal them.

As a way of contributing towards afforestation program we managed to plant trees with the inmates and the prison officers. This is also part of ensuring the prisons farms have 20% forest cover which is a directive by HE the President.

Later on visited Maranjau GK Prison where they have put extra hard work on their industry and farm which is quite impressive and encouraging. With the hard work, enthusiasm and teamwork, the Correctional Department will be able to achieve additional positive outcomes which will benefit our Nation as a whole.

While on the field visits, we encourage the inmates to keep contact with their family members back at home as part of reconciliation which builds a safer and easier environment for the inmates to fit in once they have been reintegrated back into the society.

The facilities have different rehabilitation programs including carpentry, masonry, joinery which we encourage the inmates to enroll in so as to acquire skills, while the government also works towards modernizing the equipment and the workshops.",

Until her demise, D'Souza was the Seychelles Tourism Ambassador and a successful Nairobi tour and travel operator whose business acumen was greatly admired in the tourism and hospitality industry.

D'Souza, popularly called Popsy, was eulogized and celebrated by her family and friends as a warm and passionate person who breathed energy into her environment.

The former President, who nostalgically reminisced their friendship years from back in Amherst College, Massachusetts, together with her husband Alfred and their peers, eulogized Popsy as a loyal and faithful friend who never shied from speaking her mind. He described her as one who touched the lives of many in different ways.

Other leaders who paid their glowing tributes included The Seychelles President Wavel Ramakalawan, whose condolence was read by a government representative and who eulogized the deceased as one who dispensed her duties diligently and with great enthusiasm.",

This prestigious event will bring together potato industry colleagues and partners from around the globe. It marks a significant milestone as it will be the first time this biennial business event is held in Sub-Saharan Africa.

The proposed theme for the congress is ""Developing Global Potato Partnerships for Enhanced Food Systems, Food Security, and International Trade."" This theme highlights the importance of collaboration and cooperation in addressing the challenges of food security and sustainable agriculture.

Potatoes play a vital role in Kenya, being the second most important food crop after maize. They contribute significantly to food security, poverty eradication, and economic development. By hosting the World Potato Congress, Kenya aims to showcase its expertise in potato cultivation, processing, and innovation.

The congress will offer valuable educational opportunities, promoting sustainable agriculture practices. It will also create avenues for inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work, particularly for youth and women in the sector. By bringing together experts, policymakers, and industry leaders, the event will facilitate knowledge exchange, technology transfer, and market development in the potato industry.

The 2026 World Potato Congress is expected to attract over 1,000 delegates to Nairobi for the week-long event. This gathering will not only foster networking and collaboration but also stimulate the local economy across various sectors. 

The influx of international participants will create business opportunities, boost tourism, and showcase Kenya's potential as a hub for agricultural innovation.

ABUJA, 28TH MAY 2023 (OFPP) - His Excellency (Rtd) President Uhuru Kenyatta, the Fourth President of the Republic of Kenya, on Saturday, 27th May 2023, graced the 2023 Presidential Inauguration Lecture held at the International Conference Centre in Abuja, Nigeria. 

In his keynote address at the event, themed Deepening Democracy For Development, H.E Kenyatta pointed out the importance of democracy in spurring development in any country, especially in the African Continent. 

H.E Kenyatta shared his experience as a head of state for two terms, where he acknowledged the successes, failures, and opportunities of embracing democracy, articulating the importance of getting to the root causes of conflict within the continent and our African countries for the continent's development.

The former President further pointed out the three most fundamental issues weaponized to the detriment of our democratic growth as ethnicity, tribalism, and economic greed. 

"" I feel the three most fundamental issues that are easily weaponized to the detriment of our democratic growth. The first is negative ethnicity or tribalism, followed by religion, and lastly, economic greed,"" Kenyatta said.

Kenyatta expressed his confidence that if the continent addressed these issues in earnest, it would begin to harness its mineral wealth, agricultural potential, and abundant human capital to propel the people's well-being and strengthen the continent's voice in the global community of Nations. 

The former Head of State called on President-elect Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to unite all Nigerians irrespective of religion, tribe, political and other affiliations. He further urged him to embrace the inclusivity of all parties for a better Country.

""I speak to you as a brother and an elder statesman in leadership. The contest is now over, and the hard work of building a prosperous and unified Nigeria begins"", he said.  

Acknowledging the President-elect's task once he assumes office, H.E Kenyatta urged Tinubu to transcend an election's tactical politics and become Nigeria's vision bearer.

""I encourage you to surround yourself with the voices of those who will counterbalance the hardliners that feel entitled to a piece of your office. You will lose nothing and gain everything from reaching out across political, ethnic, and religious lines to those who may feel aggrieved by your victory in one way or another. Allow them to exhale and to be a part of your vision for a greater Nigeria."" He encouraged the President-Elect. 

The former Head of State congratulated the people of Nigeria for holding peaceful elections, overlooking the challenges, and embracing the lessons from a maturing democracy. 

Furthermore, he commended all the contestants for expressing their political differences within the provided framework of constitutional order urging them to shun divisive politics and embrace finding strength in their diversities. 

Other speakers who delivered their lecturers on different aspects included; His Eminence Mohammed Sa ád Abubakar III, C.F.R. Sultan of Sokoto & Most Rev. Dr. Mathew Hassan Kukah, Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, who spoke on Tolerance and Inclusiveness, Ms. Amina Jane Mohammed, G.C.O.N., Deputy Secretary-General (Security and Development), Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina, President, African Development Bank (AfDB) who emphasized on the importance of strengthening the Nigerian Economy and Mr. Dayo Israel, National Youth Leader, All Progressives Congress who spoke on the importance of youth inclusiveness in governance.

The outgoing President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, H.E. Muhammadu Buhari, who also attended the ceremony, noted that democracy was not merely a system of governance but a way of life that requires active participation, inclusivity, and relentless pursuit of justice and fairness. 

Also present was Vice President-elect Kashim Shettima, Deputy Speaker of the Nigeria National Assembly, Hon. Ahmed Idris, among other dignitaries.

The Inaugural Lecture organized by the Nigeria Presidential transition council aims to bridge the divisions prevalent in Nigerian society, foster dialogue, and promote collective responsibility toward national development.

The Presidential Inauguration Lecture is part of the activities organized to commemorate Nigeria's Seventh consecutive civilian transition.",

Pull back. Listen to Kenyans.

Withdraw the Finance Bill 2023.

Postpone the implementation of the Housing Levy.

Return to the Drawing Board.

Hire new, independent and TRUTHFUL ADVISORS.

Reshuffle your communications team and hire two or three FRESH FACES.

Don’t rely on YES MEN and YES WOMEN.

Don’t be defensive.
Don’t argue with the PEOPLE.

Stop entrenching the perception that you are only hiring exclusively from TWO ETHNIC GROUPS.

Stop hiring and recycling incompetent failures and graft riddled conmen.

The reckless talk about TWO SHARE HOLDERS in a country of 50 million people is political suicide.

Mwai Kibaki was elected with 68% of votes but was defeated in a referendum 2 years later.

Conman @RailaOdinga is gaining popularity because many of the senior government officials you have appointed are failing to engage Kenyans in a transparent, respectful and accountable manner.

Mama Phoebe Asiyo; a woman of many firsts, hosted us at her home in Wikondiek, Karachuonyo Sub-county, Homabay County.

The pioneer woman politician and veteran activist took us through her journey, beating the odds and hurdles of a patriarchal setting to stamp authority in national politics and woman leadership. 

In her parting shot, Mama Asiyo affirmed to us that, as is with the title of her memoir, whatever one sets forth to achieve, 'It is Possible.'

NAIROBI 30th June, 2023 (OFPP): His Excellency President (Rtd) Uhuru Kenyatta, in his capacity as the Facilitator of the East Africa Community (EAC)-led Nairobi Peace Process, today held a consultative meeting with various stakeholders on the cantonment matters in North Kivu in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

The meeting, which had the representation of the EAC member states, the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO), the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), international organizations, and members of the diplomatic corps, was aimed at assisting the stakeholders in planning, organizing, and reaching a consensus on how they can collectively work towards achieving the final stage of the process initiated during the Luanda Summit held on 23rd November 2022.

One of the primary objectives of the Nairobi & Luanda Peace Processes is an orderly and swift cessation of hostilities, involving the withdrawal of armed groups from their forward positions to designated locations and the systematic and organized cantonment and disarmament of the groups.

Addressing the delegates in Nairobi, the former Head of State underscored that the cantonment is a sensitive aspect of the peace restoration process that requires transparency, open consultation, and stakeholder dialogue.

""The cantonment aspect presents a sensitive and urgent challenge. We must ensure that all parties are adequately consulted and reach an agreement regarding this crucial stage. It is imperative to address all necessary technical and logistical matters, including establishing open and indirect lines of dialogue and consultation with the armed groups we aim to canton."" The facilitator said.

The Facilitator further stated that it is paramount that the cantonment stage succeeds if substantial progress in implementing the political and military objectives of sustainable peace and stability in the eastern part of the DRC.

The former President appreciated the leadership of the East Africa Community for their unwavering commitment and determination to assist the government of the DRC in pacifying the eastern region of the country.

He further commended the militaries and Chiefs of Defence Forces of the EAC countries for their close cooperation with EAC and the military authorities in the DRC, ensuring the proper and effective deployment of these forces across various sectors.

The Facilitator called on all stakeholders to work together to complete the cantonment process noting it will set the stage for subsequent activities within the framework of disarmament, demobilization, repatriation, reintegration, and resettlement (DDRRR) required in the future.

Speaking in the forum, the Special Representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations in DRC and Head of MONUSCO, Ms. Bintou Keita, echoed H.E Kenyatta's sentiments that the cantonment should be voluntary where she assured the forum of the United Nations unwavering support in the peace process.

The DRC Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs H.E. Christophe Lutundula Apala Pêne Apala, represented the government and assured the forum of the government's commitment to the peace process.

Other dignitaries in attendance included the EAC regional force commander (EACRF), Maj-Gen Alphaxard Muthuri Kiugu, Angolan Lieutenant-General Nassone João, among others. The EAC Secretary General (SG) was represented by the Military Advisor to the EAC SG, Major Gen. Ally Mzee Katimbe.",

During my meeting with the President on the sidelines of the ongoing International Council of Nurses (ICN) Congress in Montreal Canada, she commended Kenya’s bold move saying Preventive and Promotive Health is the surest strategy to accelerate attainment of UHC.

In our mission to enhance the nursing Standards in the country we will engage with associations like ICN to ensure our nurses get exposure to global best practices. Nurses are the engines of healthcare service provision and we endeavor promote nursing as a profession and ensure they have a voice in healthcare policy and decision-making processes at the national and regional levels.

We also welcome collaborations that support the professional development of Kenyan Nurses through various capacity-building initiatives such as the Global Nursing Leadership institute (GNLI) program from which Kenya has benefited to have at least 8 alumni.

At the moment Kenya is engaged in Organizational Development of National Nursing Associations (ODENNA). a partnership of National Nurses Associations (NNA’s) in the African region designed to strengthen NNA’s ability to influence health outcomes, build respect, recognition and support profession.

We pledge to support such initiative and also continue to collaborate with ICN and the World Health Organization (WHO) to build capacity through training programs workshops, and educational resources to enhance nursing skills, knowledge, and leadership Capabilities.

We are looking forward to further engage on opportunities and network to enhance capacity building in the country. We are keen to engage WHO on campaign of 25:25:25 which aims to have 25% of health workforce trained in 25 countries by 2025.

We appreciate the partnerships to address common challenges, share best practices, and promote collaboration in areas such as education, research, and policy development, provision of  platforms  such as the ICN Congress that facilitate knowledge exchange.",

The closed-door session majorly discussed matters of cantonment and confidence-building measures among the warring parties in the eastern part of DRC. 

In his opening remarks, the Facilitator said the meeting, unlike others held outside DRC, had been convened in Goma as an indication of all stakeholders' commitment to helping the Congolese people find lasting peace solutions to the conflict.

""The peace process is about the Congolese people, and therefore being in Goma instead of meeting in capitals outside of DRC is an indication of each and everyone's commitment to finding a lasting peaceful solution to the problems that have afflicted this part of our neighboring country,"" he said.

The Facilitator recognized the importance of all stakeholders working together as a team to find a peaceful resolution for the people of DRC. He appealed to all the armed groups to cease hostilities and give dialogue a chance.

Leading the delegation of the DRC government was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, H.E Jean-Pierre Bemba, who joined the forum virtually and weighed in on the deliberations. He reassured the platform of the government's commitment to both the Luanda and the Nairobi Peace Processes. The President's Special envoy Prof. Serge Tshibangu, the Minister of State for Regional Integration, Hon. Mbusa Nyamwisi, and the North Kivu Governor, Gen. Ndima Kongba, echoed his sentiments.

Representatives of MONUSCO, led by Ms. Bintou Keita, reiterated their commitment to finding lasting peace in the war-torn Region. 

Other organizations in attendance were East African Community (EAC), African Union (A.U.), The International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), observers from various international organizations, and some members of the diplomatic Corps. The EAC Regional Force Commander Maj-Gen Alphaxard Kiugu, the MUNUSCO Ag. Force Commander Maj - Gen Benoìt Chavant and Col Timoteo Neves of the Adhoc Verification Mechanism were also in attendance.

Later the Facilitator, accompanied by the head of MONUSCO, Ms. Bintou Keita, Hon. Mbusa Nyamwisi, and other stakeholders handling issues concerned with Gender-Based Violence, who joined the meeting virtually, met with a group of women leaders who shared their concerns on the plight of women and children at the IDP camps. They requested the Facilitator to look into these issues urgently and rally allies who can participate in women empowerment activities within the camps. They sighted the lack of economic empowerment as one of the issues that left women and children vulnerable in the camps. 

H.E Kenyatta assured the women that, as the Facilitator of the EAC - led Nairobi Peace Process, he acknowledged the concerns raised and assured them of his support. He also urged the women to come together and develop mechanisms on how they, too, can play a part in finding peace.  

""Women equally have a responsibility to work closely with us, to help establish a peaceful environment. They need to be our key agents of selling the language of peace as they are the greatest beneficiaries once that peace is established"", the Facilitator emphasized. 

The Facilitator thanked the organizations working closely with the women and children, urging them to ensure they are protected and catered for relentlessly.",

Demonstrations associated with causing mayhem, destruction of infrastructure as well as personal property and looting can only put our economy at risk and worsen our current situation as a nation, since the government's efforts geared towards reviving our economy and enhancing overall development in our country won't be productive.

As leaders, we should always be honest with ourselves if we are to effectively and diligently serve the people we represent. It will therefore be quite wrong and unfair for some leaders to let their personal interests prevail, at the expense of the lives for majority of Kenyans.

Here, he had married and raised a family. And, he had sired children who knew no other home but this. This little hill of ash.

As Chief, he had intervened and mediated and presided over a lot of progressive courses. Championed for education and chaired committees over a number of fund drives, to either build schools or settle fee not only for the needy but gifted learners. 

Here, he had settled cases of domestic strife. Saw to it that some wives didn't leave their husbands and vice versa. Many marriages stood the test of time with the blessings of his beret. Right here. Under these trees, now burnt to sorry sticks.

As a disciplinarian, he ensured many children were put through school. Coerced lazy parents and made it impossible for mischievous kids to drop out of school. All these, for a better society. Right here, adult and child alike were reprimanded for their wrongdoings.

Passionately, he fought the ills and moral maladies that threatened to cripple the wheel of growth. Reduced the percentage of teen pregnancies, alcohol and other drug addiction. Right here, policies were formulated and plans hatched to punish vice. To reward virtue.

This home was a spring that nourished the lives of many. This home that now stands in a pile of ash and wreck. Razed down by a fire ignited by the same hands he held. Torched by the same people he tried to rehabilitate.

Even if we didn't mean to thank him for all the efforts he made to make us, couldn't we just then let him be?

At his age, what does he go back to? Where should he start?

No person will be allowed to hang around Nyayo House, and being a facility processing vital security documents, access will only be granted to applicants with the necessary documents and staff members. 

To facilitate an orderly, timeous, and responsive processing of passports and other citizenship documents, special desks have been established to fast track all emergency applications, including those of persons seeking medical care, academic opportunities and job openings that have clear deadlines and have presented the necessary supporting documents. 

No applicant should give any money to facilitate faster processing and issuance of passports. The backlog of 44,000 applications will be resolved within 14 days and all subsequent applications will be processed expeditiously. 

A majority of the officers in the Immigration department are professional, dedicated, and patriotic. They deserve to be commended and facilitated to undertake their duties diligently. The few officers who are colluding with brokers to demand bribes from applicants of passports and other vital documents will be dealt with firmly. 

The Immigration department will receive upto Ksh.1.3B in  appropriation in aid beginning the financial year 2023/2024 to enable the acquisition of new equipment, including printers, and revamp the department's infrastructure to offer better services to citizens across the country.

The ongoing policy and operational reforms at Nyayo House will be extended to all immigration offices countrywide, to facilitate efficient service delivery. Zero tolerance to corruption is non-negotiable and all persons seeking services at the Immigration department must be treated with courtesy. 

To streamline service delivery, emergency desks have been established to expedite the processing of passports for applicants seeking medical care abroad, students destined to learning institutions abroad and persons who have secured job opportunities in foreign countries and have reporting deadlines. Expectant and lactating mothers, parents or guardians accompanying minors, the elderly and persons with disability will also be accorded special attention at the immigration desks. 

As we work to address with finality, the production challenges through acquisition of modern printing machines, recruit additional immigration officers and improve the department’s infrastructure, all efforts and manpower has been deployed to clear the passport processing backlog within 14 days.
