October 1st,2023

WHERE SHOULD THE AFCON MATCHES BE HELD IN KENYA?

This is a joint statement by Kisumu Governor, H.E Prof Peter Anyang' Nyong'o and Kakamega Governor, H.E   FCPA Ferdinand Baraza concerning the hosting of the Africa Cup of Nations in the three East African countries in 2027.

The UDA government has announced that the AFCON 2027 football matches shall be held in Nairobi and Eldoret.

This, in our view, is a tragic decision. Western Kenya should have been included with either matches being held in Kisumu or Kakamega. 
The Western region of Kenya is where football fans exist in plenitude. NOT in Uashin Gishu, or Eldoret for that matter.

The success of the matches will be on the turn up at the stadia where the matches will be held. 
Eldoret has athletes and athletic fans in millions. But not soccer. And that is the naked truth. This means the Afcon matches will be played in empty stadia with very little impact.

The decision by the UDA government may be denying the Western region the opportunity to host the games because we are not shareholders in the Kenya Kwanza Company limited.

That would be extremely myopic as the President was representing the Republic of Kenya when he teamed with our colleagues in the East African Community. Coming back home, he seems to have changed the goal post. That's unfortunate.
It  should be noted that our neighbors who are cohosting the tournament with us, under the PAMOJA proposal, have each chosen three venues namely: Uganda-Kampala, Lira and Hoima; Tanzania-Dar e Salaam, Zanzibar and Arusha. Why can’t we do the same in Kenya?

There is still time to reconsider the decision. The people of Western Kenya are waiting.

Members of the Press,
 
We have no alternative as a leadership from a County that bore the brunt of the recent street protests against the cost of living, but must continue with the on-going  uncompromising bipartisan talks. We have  been following closely the on-going dialogue talks between the Kenya Kwanza and Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Alliance and must remind all of the thorns, stones, teargas and roadblocks to the bipartisan action.
 
We are aware that the talks have been facing some challenges ostensibly on the constitution of the Independent Electoral Boundaries Commission among other issues,but remain focused on the intent and content of the dialogue. We have come a long way as a country from the dark moments of our history and must as a people continue to struggle unwaveringly against all forces of obscurantism. 

We believe that no Kenyan citizen has to endure subhuman living conditions. Every Kenyan must have adequate food, descent shelter and clothing, adequate health, security and gainful employment. It is your right to enjoy minimum  standards of human existence. The satisfaction of basic needs is a human right at per with the right to life.   
 
After deep consultations and soul-searching, we wish to state as follows:
 
1:  That as one of the governors whose County bore the brunt of the protests including deaths, we support the dialogue and would like it to continue to a successful conclusion as per the wishes of our Party Leader PM Rt. Hon. Raila Amollo Odinga.

2:  That we appeal to the  negotiators and our leaders to give the talks a chance to help resolve issues that resulted into the demonstrations.

3:  That we assure our party leader that as leadership of the county, we support his decision to engage in dialogue and ask him count on our support.

4.  That we are aware that some leaders across the country would like the dialogue to collapse so that the country relapses back into political and economic chaos and turmoil. We should avoid such paths that will lead to more misery for the masses.

5.  That we would like to warn such leaders who have been blowing hot and cold about the talks that Kenyans will judge them harshly should the bipartisan dialogue collapse. Let what is on the table be what is under the table.

6.  That we remind leaders from both sides that time is running out and that  the faster we conclude these talks  the better for the country. Let us tone down on hardliner attitudes and embrace dialogue.

7.  That we must stay together for when we divert our focus, we will never succeed  and come out of the quagmire we are in as a country. We should never allow selfishness, egotistic and chauvinistic ways replace the cause we have believed in for so long. It is only the bipartisan talks that will get the country out of the current muddle and allow it to forge ahead with the business of development and Nation building.

Across the country, families are mourning and preparing to burry loved one who were victims of murderous police officers. Many families are in hospitals nursing loved ones who were injured by police. Tens of people have been hospitalized with gunshots and arrow and panga wounds. 

Some of the victims are young school boys and girls who were not even involved in demonstrations. Hundreds of people are also being detained in police cells or have been arraigned in court for participating in a process that is protected by the constitution. Among those in police custody is our able member of parliament for Mavoko Hon. Patrick Makau. 

We demand immediate and unconditional dropping of all charges against Hon. Makaua all those who were arrested for participating in a constitutionally protected action of protesting against punitive policies. 

We are here today to condemn the senseless brutality and Statesanctioned execution of civilians by police which is becoming the new normal in Kenya. We are deeply concerned at the repeated instances of police brutality against innocent and law abiding civilians. 

Yesterday, this brutality gained a higher notoriety. Police not only fired bullets at citizens who were gathering for a rally in Kamkunji, far from the Central Business District. They also fired teargas into a primary school in Kawangware, exposing to mortal danger innocent children who had absolutely no idea what was going on around them. 

The brutality is not ad hoc. It is coordinated and ethicized. A special ethnic-based killer squad has been formed within the police service to brutalize and carry out summary execution of civilians in the name of protecting what they have been made to believe is their regime. 

This squad is taking instructions from an equally ethnic-based command structure that operates outside the official channels of the Police Service. 

As if this is not bad enough, a killer squad that is not part of the police service is being activated to operate as part of police to brutalize Kenyans. This squad was in its true element yesterday, firing at protesters from unmarked vehicles that we know belong to police in places like Mlolongo and Kitengela. 

There were murders, injuries and arrests in as diverse places including Machakos, Kisumu, Kisii, Busia, Wote, Emali, Meru and Kilifi, among other places. We are in the process of compiling complete data from across the nation on the victims of this operation and will share the same with the country in due course. 

These acts of brutality are running side by side with politically supported acts of ethnic profiling in parts of the country where ethnic-based militias are being formed and facilitated to attack other communities with crude weapons, with the support of State. It is happening in parts of Nyanza along the Kisii/Kericho and Kisumu/ Kericho borders. It is happening here in Nairobi too. 

Someone is working on a script of ethnic profiling, antagonism and murder much similar to what was witnessed here in 1991-92, 1997 and 200-2008. The world has known of the Butcher of Cambodia before, among other butchers. Today, it would appear a Butcher of Kenya is in the making. 

We call on Kenyans to refuse to be intimidated in their own country. We urge Kenyans to be firm and resist this deliberate effort to turn the National Police Service into a killer squad for hire by politicians and regime suffering acute legitimacy deficit. We are going beyond merely condemning this emerging pattern. 

We have instructed our lawyers to prepare and institute legal proceedings against police officers who have gone against their duty of protecting life and property of Kenyans and instead become a threat to citizens. 

In this regard, we are appealing to all Kenyans who have photographic or video evidence of police brutalizing citizens to share the same with us to aid the case that our legal team is working on. 

Going forward, we appeal to Kenyans to resort to citizen journalism and photograph and film State officers, including police and politicians who, in the course of duty, abuse and brutalize citizens. 

Because the regime has decided to turn all institutions of the State against the citizens, we have no option but to act to protect ourselves. 

We are going for individual responsibility and culpability against officers. We are also going for individual culpability against police commanders whom we have reason to believe know or ought to have known about the illegal actions of the officers under their command. We stand in solidarity with the victims of this police brutality and their families. 

We will offer support to offset costs and help lessen the burden on the families. We have made a decision to observe five days of mourning and solidarity with the victims and their families during which we will try our level best to mobilize support to help lessen the burden on the families of victims. 

But we are not giving up in our quest to force Mr. William Ruto to lower the cost of living, commit to the audit of the 2022 election, bipartisan reconstitution of the IEBC and respect political parties. 

Consequently, we announce that our protests will resume on Wednesday, 19th July 2023. 

In the meantime, we proceed with the collection of signatures against Ruto on both digital and manual platforms. 

We notice the Communication Authority has joined the war against Kenyans by trying to cripple our digital signature collection platform, but we will fight and soldier on while we put the CA on notice. 

There is no looking back. There is no turning back. See you on Wednesday.",12226.0,4623.0,169.0,

Last week, we announced the launch of a program of collecting signatures for purposes of taking back the powers we delegated to our leaders. The exercise, which is ongoing, is meant to express people’s displeasure with Ruto and the raft of punitive, unfair and unjust taxes that he has decided to impose on the people, without the people’s consent.

This is part of the campaign of resistance, the civil disobedience and citizens’ actions that we have decided to pursue to force Ruto and his regime to respect and listen to the people.

The Finance Act 2023 clearly exposed the fact that our leaders have decided to take instructions from the Executive and the Executive has decided to pursue its own wishes, regardless of what the people feel or say. Both the legislature and the Executive have ganged up against the people, and the people have been left on their own. In return, the people have decided, rightly, to gang up against the Executive and the Legislature. The people have decided to invoke Article 1 of the Constitution.

The process we are engaging in is about the deliberate policy decisions by the Kenya Kwanza regime to make life unbearable to a great majority of Kenyans despite the consistent appeal by Kenyans for the regime to take actions to lessen their burden.

The digital platform we have unveiled today, is complementary to all other efforts and platforms including civil disobedience, tax boycotts and defiance that are meant to compel the regime to repeal the Finance Act 2023 and take deliberate steps to lower the cost of living.

These actions are also meant to compel the regime to address all the weighty issues that we have been pushing for, including a bipartisan reconstitution of the IEBC, audit of the 2022 elections and an end to the invasion and compromising of parties and MPs.

The digital platform we have unveiled today will therefore run alongside manual or physical signature collection, and we urge Kenyans to feel free to choose between digital and manual platforms; whichever they are comfortable with.

We are aware that Kenya Kwanza has questioned where we will take the signatures and the legality of the exercise. We don’t expect them to understand. They don’t understand the people’s power as of now, but with time, they will. But they need to understand we will not take it to the Kenya Kwanza IEBC or their compromised Parliament. We take this early opportunity to thank the 1.2 million people who have signed so far. We appeal to more people to come out and append their signatures to this historic undertaking.

As we launch this, our citizens’ engagement forums that we started in Kamkunji last week will continue. And Kamkunji will not be confined to Nairobi. As the people demonstrated last week, Kamkunji will be everywhere and anywhere across the country where Kenyans gather in the name of justice and well-being.

We sincerely thank the people who turned out and spoke loudly, boldly and fearlessly in Western, Coast, Central, Nyanza, Eastern, North Eastern, Rift Valley and of course, Nairobi last week.

We take note that in the course of our otherwise peaceful activities across the country, Kenya Kwanza responded with live bullets and killed people in various parts of the country. In Nairobi, there was an attempt to assassinate the Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga.

We know they are getting it very wrong and missing the point that what Kenyans have started is a self-propelling movement. It has never been and it will never be about an individual. Just like the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. or the detention of Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi did not stop the march for civil rights and freedom in the US, South Africa and India, no amount of shooting, teargas or even assassination will stop the march of history in this country.

However, we intend to move to court and institute prosecution against individual officers who are involved in unconstitutional and illegal actions against protesters in the course of our activities.

Our activities are protected by the Constitution. By resorting to civil disobedience and protests, we can’t be wrong unless the law itself is wrong. Kenyans must never be made to believe that they are wrong when they protest.

We therefore ask Kenyans to film, photograph and record all those police officers who shoot at or in any other way hurt protesters in the course of our activities. Such officers are acting in disregard of the constitution and we must make them pay for their illegal activities.

We are back tomorrow, at Kamkunji in Nairobi and Kamkunjis elsewhere across the country.

Once again, we appeal to Kenyans to come out in even bigger numbers and make their voices heard. With time, Ruto will respect Kenyans.

What we started last week was only the first wave. Tomorrow, we must return with an even greater force and in greater numbers. And we must keep doing this until Ruto listens to and respects Kenyans.

Finally, and most importantly, let us stay united.

We need unity now more than ever.

With unity, the fight won’t be long and we will get many of the things we desire and deserve.

Let us stick together until the end.

See you in Kamkunji tomorrow.",13609.0,3066.0,194.0,

July 4, 2023

Ladies and Gentlemen,

We gather here today because THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD ENOUGH. There comes a time when being taken for granted becomes unbearable. There comes a time when being treated as fools becomes intolerable. That time has come.

Henceforth, we are taking bold measures against the illegitimate regime of Ruto, in response to his actions against us. Ruto is imposing taxes without our consent and implementing laws that only make our lives more difficult. We cannot tolerate the current state of taxation and its accompanying injustices any longer. Ruto has even removed subsidies on essential goods like fuel, unga (maize flour), electricity, and school fees, while providing subsidies to helicopter owners and financing the lavish lifestyles of his allies with our hard-earned money.

It is evident that we are dealing with a heartless tyrant who shows no regard for the people. We are determined to rectify this situation. Therefore, we are here to announce that our Kamukunji meeting will take place in Nairobi this Friday, as previously announced. However, this is not just a gathering in Nairobi; it is a nationwide Kamukunji where we will launch the Third Liberation. On July 7th, 2023, we will initiate signature collection campaigns to express our rejection of the illegitimate Kenya Kwanza regime and its punitive tax policies.

As we speak, the prices of fuel, food, and transportation are skyrocketing. In fact, fare has already increased by 30 percent. Fellow Kenyans, as a resilient people, we refuse to suffer in silence. We do not bow down to dictators and beg for mercy. Even those who do still face humiliation and even death. So, we fight.

We raise our voices loudly and clearly on issues that affect us. Therefore, we must fight, and our fight begins on Friday. Unity is crucial now more than ever. Together, we can achieve not only our desires but also what we rightfully deserve. From Friday onwards, let us move forward with unwavering determination, standing united and working together until the end.

Violence is abhorrent to us. Our engagement in pickets, protests, tax boycotts, and civil disobedience does not advocate violence. We have never endorsed violence in the past, and we never will. We firmly believe in the law and the rule of law, and we will act within its boundaries. Our sole weapon is our sovereign power to protest, boycott, and engage in civil disobedience. We exercise this power starting on Friday, July 7th.

Fellow Kenyans, we want you to understand that WE ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE. We are not wrong. By resorting to civil disobedience and protests, we cannot be wrong unless the law itself is wrong. The same law that establishes the government and its institutions, such as parliament, the courts, and the police, also permits us to protest, picket, boycott, and present petitions. We are within our rights, and we refuse to be intimidated.

Let us remember the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who once said, ""Now it means sacrificing, yes, it means sacrificing at points. But there are some things that we've got to learn to sacrifice for. And we've got to come to the point that we are determined not to accept a lot of things that we have been accepting in the past."" As a country, we have reached that point. We invite all our fellow citizens to prepare to join the Kamukunji in Nairobi and other locations across the country on Friday.

Thank you, Kenyans. Let us gather in Kamukunji and various parts of the country for the Saba Saba of our lifetime.",11591.0,2776.0,214.0,

The Central Organization of Trade Unions, COTU (K) takes this early opportunity to thank and applaud His Excellency the President for listening to the Workers’ calls and appointing a full Cabinet Secretary in charge of the Ministry of Labour as a stand-alone Ministry as opposed to the previous arrangement where the Ministry had been merged with the affairs of East African community.  

This decision by the President to have the Labour Ministry distinct is bound to have huge and positive impact not only to the country’s Industrial Relations’ Management but equally create a conducive environment where the Ministry will fully discharge off only Labour Matters  allowing the Cabinet Secretary to concentrate on the same and equally the appointment of Hon. Ukur Yattani is applaudable considering his vast experience as a Governor and Administrator and as workers we welcome the appointment.

At the same time COTU (K) thanks the President for considering the appointment of the Former Chairman of the Federation of Kenya Employers, FKE and lately the Cabinet Secretary for Health Hon. Cleopa Maillu as the Head of UN Mission in Geneva which combines its duties with the International Labour Organisation, (ILO) Issues and as a previous key player in the tripartism arrangement, COTU (K) has no doubt that he will deliver on this mandate

We appealed to the two political sides-NASA and jubilee- to embrace dialogue even before election in August 2017.

We foresaw the current political stand-off but we were ignored.

I was even accused of belonging to NASA and had been promised a cabinet post should Raila be president.

Dialogue does not mean Uhuru or Raila will cede their positions but Kenya is bigger than all of us.

The hard-line positions being exhibited by both sides is putting majority of Kenyans and workers in problems should their be any form of violence.

I don't meant to say that NASA and jubilee should share power but we need to have a stable political environment.

We would rather as a country have a bad government than no government at all.

 Look at Libya after Gadaffi, look at Somalia after the collapse of Siade Barre's government, they have no country.

Uhuru should not completely ignore the opposition. The effects of bad politics is  for instance  being felt in Nairobi CBD- people are being mugged in broad daylight.

People are dissulusiomed and their are signs of hopelessness in many faces of Kenyans.

Our records at COTU show that we have lost more than 100,000 jobs because of the current political stand-off.

During the struggle for Independence, Masinde was convinced that the white man deployed religion as a tool for manipulation of the black man, effectively using it to colonise the minds of the native population. 

He therefore decided that true liberation could only come from complete freedom from colonialism, including religious freedom. He subsequently founded the Dini Ya Msambwa in 1948, to advocate for indigenous African worship devoid of the white man’s domination. 

The sect became popular among the locals as it incorporated cultural and traditional customs in prayer, while also acting as a freedom struggle movement for the emancipation of the black man.

While engaging in anti-colonial activities, Masinde came into contact with white rulers a lot. Confrontations abounded. At one time, he had a physical fight with a colonial administrator for refusing to kneel before him.

Masinde was later arrested and detained several times, in different locations, including at Kapenguria. He became a thorn in the flesh of colonial administrators for preaching the liberation message in prison, forcing them to move him from location to location to arrest what they considered his indoctrination of prisoners.

He closely identified with Jomo Kenyatta’s struggles and encouraged Kenyatta to be radical, as that was the language the white man would understand. He also closely identified with Jaramogi Oginga Odinga’s philosophy of “full independence can only mean political, economic, educational and religious independence”, harping on this to encourage native populations to form business thrift units so that when independence came, it would find a ready population.

Because of his radical message and insistence on both religious and economic freedom as part of the 1963 independence package, he was subsequently detained by the Kenyatta government after independence, spending time in jail until 1978, when he was released as part of Moi’s amnesty to political prisoners. This radicalism wouldn’t relent, forcing Moi to send him back to jail briefly.

He died in 1987 but his contribution remains largely unrecognized, an error I’m hoping the National Heroes Council will finally correct.",920.0,133.0,17.0,

A person who has a view of all our power generation plants and decides whose power is “dispatched” (added to the grid) and when. 

We heard testimony from cheaper green energy generators being “curtailed” (essentially being told not to supply) with the dispatcher opting for electricity from more expensive thermal generators.

I have prepared an amendment to the Energy Act to bring greater transparency hapo kwa dispatcher. Hapo kuna mchezo. The bill is ready for publication.

I have also learned from sitting on the Energy Committee in Senate that there are about 5 critical power lines that if completed would result in a way more stable grid. The infamous Turkwel-Ortum-Kitale line is one of them. The other one is the evacuation of geothermal to the coast region. Whereas it appears like common sense to prioritize these lines, attention is focused elsewhere because those projects are not “fatty” enough.

At the Energy Committee we were able to see through all the Kizungu mingi you hear from KPLC, the CS Energy, and IPP’s of sijui “grid stabilization” “base load” and “peaking plants”.

Today, the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops has issued a statement over the ongoing crisis in the country, which, if not addressed urgently by the authorities, poses an existential threat to the unity and survival of Kenya. I laud the Bishops for exercising the courage to speak up, when the more convenient default setting for other religious leaders, is to maintain a sturdy silence in the face of oppression and decline of the national fabric. 

I especially fully identify with these key issues posited in their statement;

1. That the Finance Act remains an oppressive, insensitive and ill-advised law, which should be repealed to lift the economic burden off the backs of a distressed citizenry.

2. That police brutality must end! The arming of uniformed Kenyans against the innocent unarmed citizens, constitutes a crime against humanity and perpetrators need to know that in the fullness of time, they will be held individually accountable.

3. That the government must listen to the plight of Kenyans. It is inconceivable for this regime to both purport to claim legitimacy to govern, while at the same time turning a deaf ear to the plight of the people, as it actively impoverishes and brutalises them.

I have asked, on different fora, for the Ruto regime to find someone, anyone, it can listen to, if we in Azimio are, in their view, mere purveyors of nuisance. It is not possible for everyone to be wrong and only this fraudulent regime right. Here is another opportunity to listen to people who are apolitical and hold a special place in the nation as intercessors between the population and God. 

As a baptised and practicing Catholic, may I express utmost pride in my church and its leadership today. In times of oppression, there is never a middle ground. You are either with the oppressed or the oppressor. In unequivocally making this firm statement, the Catholic church has admirably shown which side it will take if impunity becomes a way of life. I urge members of the National Police Service, majority of whom are Catholics, to heed the sound advice of our Bishops and stop brutalising fellow Kenyans.

As for this confused government, I can only finish with the famous African saying that the ears that refuse to listen to advice, soon accompany the head when it is chopped.",2132.0,393.0,39.0,

My experience with the bees of the traditional beekeepers of Kipkunur Honey Processors was so therapeutic!

Slide 1: This is what they use to smoke the bees

Slide 2: The dried skin pouch they use to collect honey. This is so much better than using a plastic bucket. I wanted one for myself!

Slide 3: Sema kufunikwa! The traditional log hive was surrounded by some more wood and mabati to protect it from rain and extreme weather patterns which is good. But it was very hard to open and was harbouring sonmany pests that could easily affect the hive. So it needs to be done in a better way...maybe just building a cover over the hive...

Training is so important because most traditional beekeepers have such strong colonies (families of bees in hives), but there are also a lot of myths and misconceptions about beekeeping that we need to demystify, and new practices we need to adopt 

Fact: In Kenya, we import 85% of our honey. And why should we when we have so much organic, natural honey?

(Wewe ulikuwa unajua juu ya hii ofisi?😌). 

The Office renders a free service that helps Kenyans both in the public and private sector get their rights. It ensures compliance with the integrity requirements in the law by public officers. It also oversees the implementation of the Access to Information Act, 2016. This free service shoulders Kenyans from having to go to court and incur a lot of legal fees to settle some matters.

I am so proud of the achievements that Cmmr. Washington Sati, MBS, the Vice Chairperson of the Commission, has achieved thus far. As a member and frontliner for advocacy in the deaf community; he has scaled the heights of success and garnered expertise in gender, disability, governance and human rights with a specialisation in social, political and economic rights.

In March/April I organised a training for about 20 of my neighbours in Beekeeping. We only managed to do the theory so we are now going progressively to each of their farms to do the practical and help them check on their hives 

Slide 1: Preparation is everything. Making sure everyone is well suited up and the random things you see around (our tools) that make our work efficient and effective 

Slide 2: It's interesting that Beekeeping is male dominated. I have to date met only one female beekeeper. I do agree a part of the work is Labour intensive...I wonder why else

Slide 3: Carefully arranging the bars in the  hives after cleaning 

Slide 4: Trying to coach my cousin on how I want the video to be taken 🤣
But most importantly...was asking because he was first checking the super (where the bees make the honey) and was asking if we will check the main box (Brood box) where they lay their eggs (kama main house) 
The excitement the men had in seeing their male counterparts (drones)!

Slide 5: I was shocked that these very active bees hadn't finished filling the main house (Brood box) calculating also the date the farmer told me he installed the hives. But also the bees maybe colonised the hive recently 

Slide 6: Cross combing is when the bees don't follow the straight line of the bars to make the honeycombs but then do it diagonally. There are many reasons they may have done so.
Cross combing makes it difficult to separate the bars during hive checks 

Slide 7: Loved this shade of yellow of the beehives. It's always good to paint your beehive in a colour that contrasts the environment.

As we mark Devolution’s 10th anniversary, we are celebrating the remarkable strides we have made so far in every sector of our economy.

To highlight a few, in Finance, County Govts have received a total of KES 2.9 trillion, that has effectively been used to significantly improve livelihoods. 

In Health, counties have progressively increased health allocation from at least 30% of their budgets- underscoring their commitment to the delivery of affordable, accessible and quality healthcare. 

In Agriculture, counties have made budgetary allocations aimed at reviving cash crop production and value addition. 

And finally, in Trade and Investment sector,in line with the President’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA), 
County Govts have now prioritized initiatives that seek to incentivize the growth of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). And the establishment of EPZs & CAIPS.
 
In all these sectors, there is very little debate about the results. Therefore it is with great pride that I declare the State of our Devolution is Strong. 

May the challenges we have surmounted and lessons learnt help us to even surpass our achievements going forward.

God bless Kenya!

The  people of Kenya and their government hereby express deepest sympathy and send condolences to the families of all victims. We also wish a speedy recovery to the injured.

Kenya strongly maintains that there exists no justification whatsoever for terrorism, which constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security.  All acts of terrorism and violent extremism are abhorrent, criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of the perpetrator, or their motivations. The international community must mobilise to bring the perpetrators, organizers, financiers, sponsors, supporters and enablers of these reprehensible criminal acts of terrorism to account and speedily bring them to justice.
 
In consideration of the complex and delicate context of the security situation in Israel-Palestine,  Kenya also makes a call for the de-escalation of violence and urges all parties to restrain from further military action, given its potential to intensify carnage and the suffering of innocent civilians, and to trigger heightened tension in the region and beyond. We are profoundly disturbed  that civilians continue to be intentionally targeted in this conflict, as a consequence of which the number of casualties continues to rise. We therefore call on all parties to respect the rights of civilians and honour their obligations under international law.

In Brief... here #SystemYaFacts..

The fact that pump prices have not changed today is consistent with the policy pronouncements of the Kenya Kwanza Administration.

1. What has been applied is stabilization not a subsidy. 

2. The Petroleum Development Levy (PDL)  was put in place to amongst other things cushion Kenyans from spikes in Petroleum Pump Prices.

The PDL is a fund for a rainy day such as this one. 

2. THE GOVERNMENT has not applied any EXCHEQUER funding which would be a SUBSIDY, but simply given back to Kenyans their money which we have collected from them in the past in the form of a levy.

3.  It is within the funds that have been collected and does not need any exchequer support as was the norm in the previous administration.

4. The Handshake regime  employed exchequer funds which made it a subsidy. The aim was singular to remain populist while avoiding the hard decisions of investing in Production. Even worse they did not pay for it, they left that burden to President Ruto to sort. Such was the don't care attitude!

5. Therefore the compensation is in the form of a stabilization fund anchored in law, it is not a subsidy.

Repeating a lie does not change the FACTS!

6.  If you look at the Kenya Kwanza manifesto - we committed to ring fencing the fund to cushion  pump Prices in a day like today.

Read the PLAN again and understand! 

Lakini of course, we know,  you would want us to sink to the low that was Handshake regime, but it will NOT happen, we are focused on investing in PRODUCTION!

The Ministry of Water, Sanitation, and Irrigation (MoWSI), with the support of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Water and Sanitation Development Partners Group, commissioned a water sector study ni July 2022 with the overarching objective of unlocking the local capital market to fund the
development of water and sanitation infrastructure in Kenya.

Following the completion of the study in February 2023, the MoWSI has commenced the process of presenting the findings and recommendations of the study for adoption by water sector stakeholders, the private sector, development partners, and other relevant actors.

During a workshop held at the Radison Blu Hotel today, i have; 

1. Asked the team to pick up momentum without a break so as to achieve the objectives & agenda.
2. Commited to provide a physical space and critical human resource that will constantly follow up on the agenda.
3. Encouraged water investment and assured investors that the government is committed to work together with investors through PPP’s including working on removing barriers and challenges that investors face.
4. Challenged different groups to challenge self beyond known parameters and also explore new market opportunities for water. 

This includes involving Local Women and Youths groups, Schools and institutions in running water resources such as boreholes  and other idle resources that are not yet utilized. 

I have also promised to follow up on filling in existing gaps that are a hinderance towards achieving the main agenda as policies are developed.

IMPORTANT TO NOTE

Capital Market Funds for the W&S sector does not have to affect public debt levels: through a non-recourse structure, failure to pay only leads to re-structuring/write off as lenders are looking to future cash flows by the WSP.

The long tenor of CMF lowers the annual debt service for a WSP, even if interest rates are high. It stretches the repayment obligation and more closely matches the useful life of the assets of WSPs in Kenya (20-30 years for civil works, and
7-8 years for mechanical and electrical works)

The discipline required to access CMF leads to performance improvement of WSPs: WSPs with good governance that show creditworthiness through improved operations can access CMF instruments

CMF as an additional financing window reduces the burden on public resources: the resources (from Gok and development partners) that are currently used on WSPs that can access other financing windows such as CMF, can be used for other, less creditworthy WSPs
